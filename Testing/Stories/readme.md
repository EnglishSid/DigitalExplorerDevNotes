## Observations

user views
- sort order of stories - ensure these are newest first by default
- can the preview be closed by clicking anywhere outside the preview
- preview - strong yellow line on the top edge
- if no banner and panel is small and black background - enforce white font.

- author is optional (remove the * )
- option to delete story from "manage stories" view - no need to go into story first
- unable to remove assigned technology groups or industries
- no upload in progress message or graphic
