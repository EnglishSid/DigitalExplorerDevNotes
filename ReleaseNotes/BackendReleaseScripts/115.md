Unused/old realtions:

`MATCH (n)-[r:ATTACHMENTS]->(m) delete r`

`MATCH (n)-[r:CONFIGURATION_PLANS]->(m) delete r`

`MATCH p=()-[r:SOLUTION_TYPE]->() delete r`

Fix Unknown attachments docType type(refers to Solutions):

`MATCH (a:Attachment)<-[:DESCRIBEDBY]-(s:Solution)
WHERE id(a) = 386534
SET a.docType='YouTube'`

Fix Unknown attachments docType (refers to Workspaces):

Select attachments to update 

`MATCH (a:Attachment)-[:INCLUDES]->(w:Workspace) WHERE a.docType='Unknown' return id(a), a.type, a.attachmentType, a.uri`

based on uri change docType to the appropriate one(PDF/WWW/PPTX/DOCX):

`MATCH (a:Attachment)-[:INCLUDES]->(w:Workspace) WHERE id(a) IN [] SET a.docType = ''`

Fix for Attachment field name misplaced:

After applying code changes (Stories and Workspaces) change Attachment node field 'type' to 'attachemntType'

`MATCH (a:Attachment) WHERE a.type is not null  SET a.attachmentType=a.type, a.type = null return a`

Change docType from 'VIDEO' to 'Video' for name unification

`MATCH (a:Attachment) WHERE a.docType='VIDEO' SET a.docType='Video'`

Change docType from 'VIDEO' to 'Video' for name unification

`MATCH (a:Attachment) WHERE a.docType='IMAGE' SET a.docType='Image'`

Verification:

`MATCH (a:Attachment) WHERE a.docType IN ['Unknown', 'VIDEO', 'IMAGE'] return count(a)` should returns 0

`MATCH (a:Attachment) WHERE a.type is not null return count(a)` should returns 0

`MATCH (a:Attachment) WHERE a.attachmentType is null return count(a)` should returns 0
