Clients have to continually increase the volume of data backups to respond to business requirements. Additionally, data centers are notorious for consuming power and space, causing IT to reach limitations ahead of plan. And in-house operations staff continuously need to keep pace with accelerating technology innovation.

Backups, and more importantly restores, must be readily available, highly secure, and within budget. Given the advancements in cloud and hybrid computing, it's time to replace capital budget backup operations, asset management, tools, and facilities with a secure, flexible pay-per-use option from a trusted partner.","Cost optimization?Unlike competitors who model increases in backup costs over time, DXC helps clients optimize and even reduce backup costs.

DXC?s storage service uses policies to move data to low-cost object storage based on the client?s access patterns of the data.","Business Challenges
Traditional data storage environments are capital intensive, lack automated, comprehensive reporting and visibility, and cannot scale as quickly as a client?s business changes. Capital purchasing cycles take too long to respond to peaks in demand. When storage demand decreases, clients pay for excess capacity that sits unused. Cloud and hybrid computing models need equally adaptive storage and recovery models, which is why many companies are adopting an as-a-service model for their storage environments. Further, many industries are experiencing merger and acquisition activities, and need to consolidate overlapping and aging infrastructures.

It does so by testing an organization's defense posture and developing vulnerability identification plans that uncover weaknesses. Services supporting this offering include Threat and Vulnerability managed and advisory services, Applications Security Services, Cyber Attack Simulation, Vulnerability Management and Vulnerability Intelligence.","The difficulty for businesses today is to understand what vulnerabilities are present and how impactful they are to the business. The DXC Threat and Vulnerability Management team have a broad set of skills in all areas of security. Our dedicated penetration testing team can deliver anything from targeted penetration testing to a full-blown cyber attack assessment. The cyber attack assessment is the first step to identifying where areas of weakness are in a customer's security posture. Use the output of a cyber attack assessment to help in defining an end to end approach to security. DXC can help define and deploy a vulnerability management solution (whether via MSS or advisory) to ensure full visibility of all network-connected assets and identify whether any vulnerabilities exist that need to be addressed and to have a view of any changes within the customer network whether authorized or not. Regional delivery capabilities ensure to support your security program within the region.

Advisory Services
DXC delivers expert assessment of the vulnerabilities that open clients' information technology (IT) systems to attackers. Our reach, scale, and access to cutting-edge research enable clients to counter global threats and vulnerabilities. Long-standing clients trust DXC to handle sensitive data according to industry best practices.

Prioritize resources?DXC conducted a high-level gap analysis to ISO 27001 standards for a university that experienced over 9000 unknown devices connecting to its network annually. This enabled the university to prioritize IT resources to efficiently achieve its security and business objectives.
International scale?When a U.K.-based law firm opened offices in Asia, its small IT department needed help to ensure their data security across the globe. DXC supported the build-out of a secure, global infrastructure.
Industry-aligned expertise?DXC enabled a multinational travel reservations company to secure remote and Internet access for 500,000 roaming endpoints, shared kiosks, and handheld devices while achieving cost savings over the legacy network topology.
Managed Security Services
Proactive protection?Assessments reveal vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities threaten security. Compromised security leads to costly breaches. Avoid this path with Vulnerability Scanning, which proactively prevents threats before they impact clients' operations.
Fewer attacks?When combined with Security Monitoring, Vulnerability Scanning automatically correlates security events with scan data. The enriched information provides further context that improves threat management and thwarts future attacks.
Visibility and control?With the self-service portal, clients gain an integrated view of their risk posture and 24/7 access to vulnerability and threat data, incidents, and change requests.
Reduced complexity?Global security experts help clients understand and prioritize vulnerabilities, control IT risk, and prevent attackers from leaking valuable information.
Cost savings?Clients do not incur CapEx costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of an on-premise scanning infrastructure while also avoiding costly breaches due to devastating disruptions.","Without a sound security program, companies often experience game-changing losses when vulnerabilities are exposed by hackers or disgruntled employees. The resulting data breaches damage brands and reputations, which are difficult to repair in a highly competitive marketplace. Add lost intellectual property fines and hefty remediation costs, and the results of a cyber attack can be catastrophic. DXC can provide a full breakdown of a business's vulnerabilities and where areas of weak security could be improved. DXC can provide an ongoing vulnerability management program whether part of a managed service or completely bespoke. Let DXC test your security as a dedicated attacker would to identify gaps and help define your managed security requirements.","The DXC Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) team is a unique, global team with a vast depth and breadth of experience in security testing, backed by one of the largest information security specialist teams in the world.

Reference DataSet,SubOffering,Workplace and Mobility,MWS Unified Communications,DXC Unified Communications Services,General Availability,"Enable seamless, highly productive, multichannel communication, including enterprise-class voice through Skype for Business, Avaya or Cisco, all while cutting costs.","DXC Unified Communications Services (UCS) ensures communications quality and performance for clients, whether delivered from the cloud, on premises, or as a hybrid in a highly available architecture. DXC UCS consolidates communications and intelligent collaboration features such as IP telephony, audio/video conferencing, desktop/ application sharing, white boarding, polling, instant messaging (IM), presence, calendar, voice mail, and unified messaging into a single offering.

DXC UCS can integrate the client's existing unified communications (UC) infrastructure and provide a single point of accountability for delivering an ecosystem of preintegrated, pre-certified partners that includes Microsoft's Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, Cisco, Avaya, multiple carrier partners, and other hardware and software vendors. DXC's certification as a Microsoft MyAdvisor ? Practical Guidance for Cloud Voice launch partner, combined with DXC's tools, resources, and subject matter experts, are of critical importance when ensuring a successful Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams deployment.","DXC Unified Communications Services help clients modernize outdated telephony systems and increase the value of investments in intelligent collaboration software such as Microsoft Office 365 by beginning the transition to services delivered from the cloud or a hybrid cloud. Collaboration tools such as instant messaging, real-time co-authoring capabilities, and simple-to-use and affordable video conferencing can reduce human latency for quicker business decisions. This intelligent collaboration leads to cost savings, increased employee productivity, and a simplified and improved mobility experience.

Reduce operational costs?Transformation of existing communications infrastructure to reduce carrier and conferencing costs.
Improved employee productivity?Real-time information sharing and use of modern collaboration tools that dramatically revolutionize the way people work.
Employee mobility and flexibility?Enhance the mobile experience for employees who want easy-to-use, anytime, anywhere access to voice, video, and collaboration technologies.","Introducing a true Unified Communications solution to an organization can appear daunting to the IT organization. Will users give up their phones? Can they keep their phone numbers? A successful implementation may depend on demonstrable cost savings, but requirements (that reinforce elements of the status quo) may paradoxically defeat the UC business case. DXC believes that employees are able to change how they work and quickly enjoy the benefits of UC and intelligent collaboration. DXC can assist organizations to embrace this change, and in doing so, become more competitive.","Management and multi-vendor support?DXC has a global delivery team with resources throughout the world providing centralized management, operations and multi-language support of multiple UC solutions including Microsoft (Skype for Business), Cisco and Avaya.

Virtualized applications and desktops are accessible from a company's secure network or from the public Internet, allowing users flexible and secure work location and device options, including bring your own device (BYOD). The service bundles end-user assessment, solution design, implementation, and ongoing management for a monthly per-user price. VDA can decrease end-user support and management costs, while significantly increasing data security by moving it off endpoint devices into the datacenter. Support for iOS, Android, Macintosh and Windows endpoint devices provides users with device choices beyond the company PC and better datacenter-based application performance.","The introduction of Windows 10, BYOD, and cloud services together pressure to reduce costs are driving enterprises to deliver workplace services differently.
