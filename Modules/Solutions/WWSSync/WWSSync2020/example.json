          "page_body": "DXC UltraGenda provides appointment booking, resource scheduling, online referrals and bookings, followup of planned appointments, and management reporting tools for hospitals, primary and community healthcare organizations. It helps healthcare organizations improve efficiency, enhances the quality of patient experience, and increases staff productivity and accountability. Hospitals and primary and community healthcare delivery organizations are under increased pressure to achieve efficiencies and quality of service. This makes cooperation across departments essential for the efficient delivery of healthcare services. DXC UltraGenda Enterprise Scheduling solution offers a robust, generic software product to better manage the scheduling processes, reducing inefficiency and improving service levels. DXC UltraGenda provides not only high quality packaged software, but a complete approach to take healthcare scheduling to the next level. Leading the way with digital health platforms — DXC offers end-to-end digital healthcare transformation services from strategic advisory services to industry software, transformation, integration, deployment and operational management. Comprehensive solution that is deployed alongside different EMR/EPRs — DXC UltraGenda provides a best of breed solution for all healthcare resourcing needs that can be deployed alongside one or more EMR or EPR systems. Quick to deploy for small scale services — For an Enterprise scheduling system DXC UltraGenda can be quick to deploy for a pilot or single department or small organization use. DXC UltraGenda already has a deploy base across a large number of customer across Europe and ANZ. DXC UltraGenda has been deployed against a large number of different EMR and EPR systems.. Manage Resources Efficiently for Direct Cost Savings Client Challenges: Need to reduce the time to book appointments by eliminating paperwork and optimizing the workflow. Move the booking process to the source of the request: department, nurse, departmental secretary. Allow secretaries to change departments without complications. Create a floating secretarial staff. Current State: Internal appointments are ordered via paper documents. Booking complex and grouped appointments - even spread over distinct departments and sites - is a very challenging exercise. Booking rules, doctors' preferences and specific exceptions are known only by dedicated secretaries. Desired Future State: Paperless; Bookings at source; Agile, lean staffing across departments. DXC Answer: UltraGenda Pro (UltraGenda's core solution) allows appointment booking at the source: the physician, a departmental nurse or secretaries in other departments. Several appointments can be booked at once, across departments and distinct sites. The simple user interface is intuitive, and training takes only a few hours, which allows switching secretaries between departments, setting up a floating staff and using interim workers. UG Broka (the internet branch of UltraGenda) enforces this booking at the source by allowing external referrers and patients to book appointments. Empower Patients Client Challenges: Healthcare providers are involved in every patient interaction. This is very time-consuming and often does not add value. Administrative tasks can be done without staff interference. From a patient perspective, every interaction is dependent on the availability of the care provider and their staff. This does often not match with their personal agenda. Current State: Hospitals are unable to allow patients to manage their own appointments, due to current booking systems lacking intelligent, configurable business rules to support this process. As a result, hospitals are required to employ large numbers of staff to fulfill patients' scheduling needs and to communicate patients' requirements. Desired Future State: Empowered patients, who are able to do more by themselves when and where they wish. This requires a solution that supports the business requirements, without a degradation in service or outcome. The right patient is seen at the right time in the right department for the right activity, thanks to intelligent rules. DXC Answer: DXC UltraGenda Broka (UltraGenda's web portal solution) empowers patients in the appointment booking process. Patients can book, cancel, and reschedule appointments, all without interference from healthcare provider staff, but in line with the demands and requirements of the healthcare provider. Reduce No-shows Client Challenges: Patients are very busy with their own activities and often forget their medical appointments. Current State: Healthcare providers are often faced with no-shows for appointments, resulting in the waste of expensive resources.. Desired Future State: Increased attendance rate at appointments, due to improved Healthcare Provider-Patient communication and involvement DXC Answer: DXC UltraGenda Pro provides patients with a convenient appointment reminder service. Reminders can be attached to both single and multiple appointments, so that patients receive advanced warning of upcoming appointments, enabling them to confirm, reschedule or cancel them. Availability: Global Pricing/Licensing model: Licenses are priced based on the size of an organization. This size is based on the number of Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) in the hospital (i.e., all staff, from housekeeping to physicians and professors). For very small institutions that do not require complex booking (e.g., booking a room, booking a physician), a renting model may be considered based on the number of schedules. Implementation: Depending on the size of the organization, a typical implementation starts from 25 days of technical and functional services, but this can easily exceed hundreds or even thousands of days for very large implementations.

To secure better clinical outcomes Client Challenges: Success for hospital providers is defined by achieving the best possible clinical outcome for each patient. Currently, this is a challenge as full information about a patient's treatment and their care pathway may not be available to all treating clinicians, leading to poor decisions and deviations from best practice. There is also a need to comply with an ever-increasing range of targets and quality measures. Current State: Healthcare records are still largely paper-based, which constrains where and when healthcare can be delivered. Desired Future State: Information about a patient's treatment and care pathway available easily so all treating clinicians can understand the case and conform to best practice. DXC Answer: DXC x-HIS replaces paper by collecting information about a patient into a single comprehensive Electronic Patient Record (EPR) which gives everyone involved in the delivery of care to that patient access to all the information they need, regardless of where they are located. x-HIS offers a dynamic, agile assistance and time optimization, releasing admin tasks, promoting the best Care Quality and improving safety processes for the patient. Interoperability Client Challenges: Staffing and skillsets are not available to integrate aging systems. Current State: Customers need to integrate a multitude of third-party departmental solutions in order to present a unified and broad view of a patient. Desired Future State: Disparate systems are integrated and data is available electronically. DXC Answer: x-HIS is an interoperable solution with the ability to integrate a multitude of administrative, clinical, and departmental functions. Reducing costs Client Challenges: Healthcare organizations are under significant budget constraints as the cost of healthcare continues to rise. Current State: Some hospitals are still largely run on paper-based systems. This means that information is captured on paper and then often keyed into a computer system later by administrative staff. This is inefficient in a number of ways: It requires administrative staff to capture information at additional cost Paper is sometimes lost, resulting in some activity not being recorded and, therefore, not billed Information is sometimes transcribed incorrectly, thereby leading to incorrect billing. Desired Future State: Integrated patient record captured at the point of care. DXC Answer: x-HIS can help reduce costs by: Ensuring that all activity is properly recorded; Reducing duplicate data; Reducing processes improving the decision making process; and optimizing existing systems.

          "page_body": "DXC's MedChart provides hospitals, clinics and aged care facilities with an end-to-end electronic medication management (eMM) solution, helping healthcare organizations reduce clinical risk and improve medication safety. MedChart eliminates complex, time-consuming manual and paper-driven medication management processes, reducing errors, improving efficiency and enabling greater coordination between clinical teams for better patient care. MedChart Features Electronic Medication Chart Electronic Prescribing Pharmacy Review Decision Support Ward Overview Medication Administration Reference Viewer Outpatients Forms Writer Benefits Accurate, efficient and timely medications administration A clear picture of each patient's medication record, accessible at any time Reduction in manual, paper chart-based inaccuracies and medication errors Decision support configurable to support the various needs of the care team - promoting best practices while preserving clinical freedom Greater pharmacist/pharmacy involvement in clinical care Ability for nurses to coordinate care and share responsibilities Improved communication between nursing, medical, and pharmacy staff Configurable protocols to support quality-based complex prescribing Delivery of security and traceability throughout the medication process Healthcare organizations are under pressure to reduce adverse drug events causing harm to patients, reduce spending on medications and improve efficiency. Implementing an electronic medication management system is well documented to immediately improve medication prescribing and administration practices, reduce incidence of medication error and improve collaboration among the doctors, nurses and pharmacists to deliver faster and better care. Leading the way with digital health platforms — DXC offers end-to-end digital healthcare transformation services from strategic advisory services to industry software, transformation, integration, deployment and operational management. Usability — MedChart is widely considered by clinicians as the most user-friendly system currently available in the market. Proven product — MedChart is tried, tested and proven, used by leading hospitals in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, and includes a range of separate workflows for optimum medication management. Electronic medication management (eMM) systems have been shown to reduce the rate of potential adverse drug events (ADE) by 71% leading to estimated savings of A$63-66 per admission (MedChart) (Westbrook, 2012). Use of MedChart has seen annual savings of $100k per 30-bed ward (Westbrook, 2015) “Waitemata DHB has MedChart deployed across approximately 970 beds on three campuses with the remaining 130 adult beds scheduled to be deployed by the end of 2017. Over 1000 active prescribers can access MedChart from any device that has access to the DHB’s network, and 2,500 nurses use iPad mini devices to administer more than 300,000 doses of medication per month. Feedback has been that MedChart reduces administration errors, and reduces the time spent trying to locate paper medication records. MedChart has certainly had a positive impact on medication management at Waitemata DHB.” - David Ryan, Project Manager, Waitemata DHB Build and maintain a reputation for delivering excellent healthcare (patient safety) Client Challenges: Clinical negligence cases continue to rise due to avoidable mistakes in hospitals. In a market that is increasingly seeing hospitals competing with each other for patients, it is important that the service is seen to be good for both referring GPs and patients. Current State: Mistakes happen in hospitals, often due to poor information availability which prompts contra-indicated prescribing and treatment. Poor communication with related health professionals regarding the patient care pathway/treatment discourages referrals. Desired Future State: A clear record of all treatment for clinicians and automatic alerts for repeat or contra-indicated medication prescribing and administration reduces mistakes. Instant production of treatment records for related health professionals ensures good communications and encourages repeat referrals. DXC Answer: Many of the problems with mistakes in hospitals stem from the use of handwritten, paper-based systems. The replacement of handwritten notes and prescribing forms with a legible, secure electronic record will reduce simple errors. Medchart does this. With patient information in electronic form clinicians can be supported with decision support systems to ensure that simple errors such as dose miscalculation, drug-to-drug reactions and allergies can be flagged by the system. Enhance operational efficiency / increase resource utilization Client Challenges: Current paper-based medicine management processes struggle to meet the demands of a modern healthcare service, are often not efficient and are prone to errors and duplication. In addition, poor medicines management can lead to pressure on drug expenditure. Current State: Healthcare records are still largely paper-based, which constrains delivery and safety of healthcare and increases costs. Desired Future State: Information about a patient's treatment and care pathway available easily so all treating clinicians can understand the case and conform to best practice. DXC Answer: MedChart eliminates paper by providing a real-time, comprehensive electronic patient medication record; the medication record gives authorized healthcare practitioners involved in the patients' care access to all the information they need, regardless of where they are located. MedChart improves the quality of information captured by enabling information to be captured at the point of care delivery. It supports local formulary management at the point of prescribing, such as prescribing protocols and preferred treatment regimes. It gives administrators and clinicians the tools to record patient information in real-time. Reducing costs Client Challenges: Healthcare organizations are under significant budget constraints as the cost of healthcare continues to rise. Current State: Some hospitals are still largely run on paper-based systems, expenditure on drugs is rising and inability to manage high-cost treatments to specific groups of prescribers. Desired Future State: Integrated patient record captured along with prescribing guidance at a point of care to the most cost-effective and proven treatment regimes coupled with the ability to restrict high-cost treatments to specific groups of prescribers. DXC Answer: DXC Medchart provides a single integrated information source that enables hospitals to change their business process to ensure that information is being captured electronically and prescribing managed in real-time.

DXC Data Governance improves compliance, business efficiency and productivity, information security, and operational costs. DXC offers flexible delivery options (on-premises, as a service, or hybrid) and commercial models to minimize investment risk. Massive amounts of data mean nothing if clients cannot internalize, visualize and optimize information to make the crucial decisions that will lead to growth and tangible outcomes. The integration of DXC Data Governance with end to end solutions that match key business needs enable DXC Technology clients to achieve measurable business benefits. A packaged goods company achieved cost savings in excess of $10M with a single, consolidated and harmonized spend analysis database that allows the company to leverage opportunities globally and more effectively manage external spend, enabled by master data management (MDM).  DXC implemented MDM for a global energy company to create the single source for well productivity, crucial for guiding investment decisions. A proof of concept (PoC) for 200 wells demonstrated improved insight, quality and cost reduction, and the company then rolled MDM out to 20,000 wells.  For a leading automotive manufacturer, DXC delivered a data governance program for warranty data — structured and unstructured — enabling the company to identify defect trends much faster, include data from additional data sources, and achieve return on investment (ROI) in only 9 months.

Proven product for market — Product is proven and referenceable within the market. Product is deployed and live at a number of healthcare organizations across UK NHS. Lorenzo has been sold within the ANZ market. DXC can deliver 99% availability, zero data loss, and zero downtime for upgrades increasing patient and hospital staff satisfaction. To secure better clinical outcomes Client Challenges: Success for hospital providers is defined by achieving the best possible clinical outcome for each patient. Currently this is a challenge as full information about a patient's treatment and their care pathway may not be available to all treating clinicians and supporting staff, leading to poor decisions and deviations from best practice. There is also a need to comply with an ever-increasing range of targets and quality measures. Current State: Healthcare records are still largely paper-based, which constrains where and when healthcare can be delivered. Desired Future State: Information about a patient's treatment and care pathway available easily so all treating clinicians can understand the case and conform to best practice. DXC Answer: DXC Lorenzo replaces paper by collecting information about a patient into a single comprehensive Electronic Patient Record (EPR) which gives everyone involved in the delivery of care to that patient access to all the information they need, regardless of where they are located. Lorenzo improves the quality of information captured by enabling information to be captured at the point of care delivery. Lorenzo gives administrators and clinicians the tools to record patient information in real time. This information can be captured using structured forms and prepared responses. Using this information Lorenzo already generates some 200 plus standard reports but also provides users with the ability to build their own reporting systems. Build and maintain a reputation for delivering excellent healthcare Client Challenges: Clinical negligence cases continue to rise due to avoidable mistakes in hospitals. In a market that is increasingly seeing hospitals competing with each other for patients, it is important that the service is seen to be good for both referring GPs and patients. Current State: Mistakes happen in hospitals, often due to poor information availability which prompts contra-indicated prescribing and treatment. Poor communication with related health professionals regarding the patient care pathway/treatment discourages referrals. Desired Future State: A clear record of all treatment for clinicians and automatic alerts for repeat or contra-indicated medication prescribing and administration reduces mistakes. Instant production of treatment records for related health professionals ensures good communications and encourages repeat referrals. DXC Answer: Many of the problems with mistakes in hospitals stem from the use of handwritten, paper-based systems. The replacement of handwritten notes and prescribing forms with a legible, secure electronic record will reduce simple errors. Lorenzo Clinical Documentation and Lorenzo Prescribing does this. With patient information in electronic form clinicians can be supported with decision support systems to ensure that simple errors such as dose miscalculation, drug-to-drug reactions and allergies can be flagged by the system. One of the most common complaints from patients is that they are asked the same question over and over again as they progress through their stay in a hospital. Lorenzo prevents this via an integrated system that captures information once and makes it available to whoever needs it. It is common for patients to be subjected to multiple repeated and unnecessary tests. Lorenzo's Requests and Results automatically check for duplicate tests. Lorenzo uses Clinical Documentation to generate immediate discharge summaries which are both comprehensive and available whenever a patient is discharged. Reducing costs Client Challenges: Healthcare organizations are under significant budget constraints as the cost of healthcare continues to rise. Current State: Some hospitals are still largely run on paper-based systems. This means that information is captured on paper and then often keyed into a computer system later by administrative staff. This is inefficient in a number of ways: It requires administrative staff to capture information at additional cost Paper is sometimes lost, resulting in some activity not being recorded and, therefore, not billed Information is sometimes transcribed incorrectly, thereby leading to incorrect billing. Desired Future State: Integrated patient record captured at point of care. DXC Answer: DXC Lorenzo provides a single integrated information source that enables hospitals to change their business process to ensure that information is being captured electronically in real time. Note: DXC Lorenzo is currently sold as part of the DXC Care Suite.

It is possible to define and continuously adjust the workspace of the individual staff member so that it supports their daily work. The modules of DXC VITAE Suite contain targeted functionality and each module can be configured and adjusted to local organizations, classifications, and the need for documentation. It is also a mobile solution that can be used online at the citizen's home, with full access to all records and with offline capabilities that ensure access to selected data even when there's no network coverage.

Single comprehensive solutions across the ecosystem — some competitors have niche products that support a single area whereas DXC VITAE Suite supports multiple areas (Home care, Community care, Nursing homes, Rehabilitation, Social Services) in one product and database enabling care coordination and consolidated reporting. Note: DXC VITAE Suite can also be delivered stand-alone to support one area or combined. DXC VITAE SUITE is currently deployed at approximately 20 customers/organizations It currently covers potentially 1.3 million citizens across clients/municipalities Improving efficiency Client Challenges: Cost of documentation process & time travelling too high. Current State: Documentation process is heavily paper-based, slow and cumbersome and typically completed back in the office after the visit. Desired Future State: Optimized visits and a reduction in documentation time by at least 50 % including: Less service personnel time spent on documentation; Higher quality of the documentation as the citizen confirms the result. DXC Answer: DXC VITAE Suite uses route planning and case management optimization to reduce the time spent on the road. For documentation, do it together with the patient while at his or her house. The VITAE Go mobile solution for iOS and Android give this opportunity. Improve quality and coordination of care Client Challenges: Lack of or unreliable sharing of information. Patients not able to directly engage in their own health improvements. Low service quality with inefficient utilization of employees and care workers. Current State: Inefficient and unreliable exchange of information. Desired Future State: More efficient and reliable exchange of information provided by: Digital communication and exchange of information; Documentation of treatment that is digital and meeting federal regulations and caregivers and ordering authority enabled to access critical client and patient information anytime, anywhere. DXC Answer: DXC VITAE Suite enables digital communication, enforces structured documentation of treatments and exchanges documentation with national databanks. VITAE Care Portal enables a secure way for the clients to offer the patients easy interaction and access to their care record. Its planning tool receives automatically all the scheduled services so it can automatically utilize and distribute the service among the care workers that are going to deliver all the services to the citizens. Security of access to data Client Challenges: Ensuring that only authorized personnel can access client and patient information. Current State: Lack of secure storage of patient information creates risk that unauthorized personnel may be able to access client and patient information. Desired Future State: Secure storage of patient and client information that allows: Client and patient information to be accessed securely at the point of care; Caregivers and ordering authority enabled to access critical client and patient information anytime, anywhere.

          "page_body": "DXC MicroHIS is designed for efficient consulting and practice management. It helps Dutch General Practitioners improve efficiency, enhances the quality of patient experience, and increases staff productivity and accountability. MicroHIS enables patients to make their own appointments and re-order their chronic medication via a portal that is managed by an assistant at the practice/clinic. DXC MicroHIS is known for its broad scale of communication/interface capabilities with hospitals, laboratories, national spine, decision support tools, scientific research programs of several universities, and single sign-ons with a variety of applications of third parties. It has a user-friendly solution for the Episode Oriented Register (EGR). Required data is derived from all relevant screens and are accessed directly on the relevant Episode link. With MicroHIS, it is also possible to maintain one or more sub-contacts together in the worksheet and link them to relevant episodes. Primary and community healthcare delivery organizations are under increased pressure to achieve efficiencies and quality of service. DXC MicroHIS allows for very fast data processing and provides users with optimal working speed, and navigation through the application with a minimum number of clicks. New patients are processed quickly and clearly on the system via a screen. Data can then be transferred to Excel or Word from various screens for further processing. Leading the way with digital health platforms—DXC offers end-to-end digital healthcare transformation services from strategic advisory services to industry software, transformation, integration, deployment and operational management. Comprehensive solution that has been designed in consultation with users—The product's \"look and feel\" is familiar, but is also stylish and innovative. The uniform and clear presentation of data—and the ability to choose a unique color scheme for the tool—makes working with MicroHIS very attractive. Quick to deploy —DXC MicroHIS is available as a hosted service making it quick to deploy and rollout to new customers. DXC MicroHIS is currently deployed at approximately 600 customers (GP's). They are responsible for circa 2 million patient records. The first \"MicroHIS Patient Notification Pillar\" went live in a large primary care center in April 2014. Create single point of contact Client Challenges—When facing problems, the client is often sent from pillar to post between the different suppliers; this causes dissatisfaction. Current State—The GP practice faces many suppliers for the wide variety of ICT-related activities, such as software, hosting, hardware, communication, consultancy, support and training. Desired Future State—Single point of contact for all aspects of service including software, hosting, consultancy, and end-user support. DXC Answer—DXC provides a single point of contact which offers the client clarity, shortens the pass-through time of issues which increases customer satisfaction. Create a coordinated care solution for chronic patient care Client Challenges—Patients' medical data is fragmented across different applications provided by multiple suppliers. This results in significant differences in process and outcome indicators. On an authorized regional level, these differences create inefficiencies and can have a negative impact on reimbursements for GP practices. Current State—The client has a wide variety of different applications in place from several suppliers. Desired Future State—Integrated solution for GPs and care community groups in primary care. DXC Answer—An integrated solution for basic GP care and specialized care for chronic patients, which allows regions to buy a total solution for day-to-day care for patients in primary care. This solution offers clients a major step forward in reliable data and cost effectiveness. Create a strong service-oriented approach Client Challenges—The client is shopping for additional services in the market; these frequently do not meet their needs. Other companies' knowledge of MicroHIS to develop additional services, consultancy and training is often too limited. Clients nowadays need not only software, but extra services and consultancy so that GP practices are well run and are able to fulfill their commitments, both internal and external. Current State—Clients are shopping in the market for additional services to create a total solution. Desired Future State—A total solution that includes a broad service palette for a strong commitment between customers and supplier. DXC Answer—DXC has broadened the current software and hosting solution to include more service components–e.g., training programs, consultancy offerings, and service modules–than it had previously. This contributes to a stronger brand name for our solution and results in satisfied clients. Availability:—The Netherlands Pricing/Licensing model—Pricing is made up of software licensing and hosting charges. Minimum software license is based on 2.350 patients per GP practice. Licenses are priced based on the size of an organization. The factors that determine pricing include number of patients, number of add-on modules, number of add-on services and number of data connections.

The conversations started with the digital agent on mobile devices move seamlessly over to tablets or laptops, creating better customer experiences. Mobile consumers want information and answers to questions immediately. DXC Digital Agent Services combines natural language processing and an advanced AI engine that reduces cost to serve, improves first contact resolution and improves the customer experience with real-time results. Highlights include: Reduce cost — DXC Digital Agent Services proved that answers can be automatically addressed by a digital agent up to 70% of the time, deflecting an average of 30-40% of calls. Accelerate time to value — Digital agents can be deployed and fully operational in less than 60 days. Efficiency and accuracy — Digital agents have increased first contact resolution (FCR) by 70%. Proven experience — DXC Technology has deployed over 200 unique digital agent use cases with industry-specific libraries. Ability to demonstrate savings, and accelerate bot adoption — The technology powering DXC's Digital Agent Services is currently used in over 60 million interactions per year.

Many customer experience (CX) organizations are struggling with finding a cost-efficient way to meet the demands for always-on customer service. Enterprises need to reduce cost to serve and deflect interactions from higher cost channels. Customers expect relevant, accurate, real-time results and first contact resolution, and every interaction to be seamless. A conversation started with a bot should not have to be repeated to a live agent. Enterprises face the challenges of understanding what interactions to move to a chatbot, how to implement a chatbot and how to ensure the chatbot answers customers' questions accurately at the first try. Typical deal size — 300K ABR, 1 million total contract value (TCV) QuickStart POV — 50-50K POV, implemented as pilot for 90 days Language support — 15 languages Pricing — Per interaction model pricing, allowing for rapid scale    CLIENT  REGION  INDUSTRY  CLOSED/WON     Valley National Bank  Americas  Banking & Capital Markets  Oct 2018    Ministry of Defence UK  UKIMEA  Public Sector  Jun 2018   CaixaBank  S.

Incomplete and inconsistent controls–failure of managing controls or inappropriate controls or overlap of security controls across the organization increasing risk of fines and failed audits. Outdated and incomplete reporting–reporting done manually takes weeks and doesn't cover the entire organization due to information silos. It leads to decisions and response prioritization based on the wrong facts and incomplete picture. Lack of ownership–leads to unresolved issues as no one takes responsibility on mitigation actions for risk, and inefficiency as same findings are handled over and over in each risk, compliance or audit management activities. Manual GRC processes–manual gathering and verification of risk and compliance data, unnecessary procedural friction delaying business activities lead to high cost and inefficiency as time and resources are wasted. Tactical and bottom-up technical silos–investment is allocated to implement the latest security trend/tech, without addressing first the security foundations results in a lack of alignment between controls deployed and business objectives. Lack of optimization, automation and reinventing the wheel–increase time, cost and risk.

What is their risk appetite? How effectively does their cyber security risk management enable their business? DXC Security Diagnostic Services can quickly tell clients where they stand and provide clear recommendations for accelerated results by: Assessing the current state of the enterprise risk management and creating an actionable plan of execution Using DXC Cyber Reference Architecture to accelerate digital transformation Use these Conversation starters: Has the corporate security strategy been defined, describing how the client would like the security posture to look in two to five years time, in terms of vision, goals and objectives to be achieved including how to address sophisticated risks to their personal, financial and business-critical information? Does the client have a defined security improvement plan or set of projects and initiatives to address business risks? How does the client ensure the right balance between business opportunities and risk as they move to cloud and mobile solutions? Does the client has a full visibility of security risks cross businesses related to people, processes and technologies? Does the client need to meet compliance mandates (ISO 27001, PCI DSS or similar regulations)? Do they need to meet compliance with least amount of effort and cost? How does the client identify security controls and define adequate enterprise security architectures aligned to their business? If any portion of the client's business forms part of Critical National Infrastructure, how does this influence their security risk management? If the client has a CISO or equivalent, how effectively are they able to do their job, and what could help them do it better? And if they do not have a CISO or equivalent, what is the reason for this? How effective is the client's information security steering committee, or equivalent group? And if they don't have such a group, why not?",

          "page_body": "Organizations that opt for service management for their digital transformation must choose from hundreds of partners for implementation, licensing and run support. The challenge is to find a partner who can offer the best pricing, terms and conditions, and depth and breadth of ServiceNow experience. DXC Technology offers two options to maximize the value of ServiceNow licenses—a traditional resell model and an innovative lease model. Each has a strong value proposition for clients. When organizations decide to make a strategic investment in the ServiceNow platform, they're looking for the best pricing, desirable terms and an optimized license bundle to minimize underuse. In addition, clients often select the same partner for both transition and transformation services. Few partners can deliver in all these areas. DXC can—we are the top competitive ServiceNow partner in delivering on those needs. Pricing and terms—DXC leverages its scale across enterprise customers to offer the lowest price and additional flexibility in terms and conditions compared to other partners, or even ServiceNow itself.  Phased license rollout —DXC has the flexibility to strategically plan a solution that rolls out licenses in phases, potentially saving the client hundreds of thousands of dollars over the contract term.  End-to-end services—DXC's ServiceNow practice represents ServiceNow's longest standing partnership, with thousands of successful customer projects over 10 years. DXC offers a one-stop shop for customers: advisory services, licenses, implementation and ongoing managed services.  Maximized value and minimized waste—ServiceNow and other resellers require clients to purchase all licenses upfront, although they may not be needed until months later. DXC allows clients to phase license investments, thereby delivering significant savings.  DXC purchasing power—DXC's volume and scale allow significantly lower pricing than an individual client can obtain, offering substantially lower pricing than any other reseller—including ServiceNow itself, in many cases.  One vendor agreement—By providing end-to-end ServiceNow solutions, we help customers shorten the procurement process and avoid multiple MSA negotiations with separate vendors.  More SKUs than any other partner—DXC can sell more ServiceNow license SKUs than any other partner, even more than the ServiceNow direct sales team can. Our (retroactive) access to the best license entitlement bundles ensures the best-fit scope and budget based on each client's environment.  Professional services and certifications—DXC's ServiceNow practice is ServiceNow's longest standing partnership, with 10 years of implementation experience and one of the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry. 3,000+ successful ServiceNow implementations Highest customer satisfaction score of all globally certified partners Hundreds of ServiceNow license clients through both of DXC's offering spanning the Global footprint Negotiation power to gain the most sizable clients to go to DXC versus any other partner or ServiceNow direct #1 ServiceNow ecosystem provider Highest customer satisfaction score of all globally certified partners Recognized with multiple top awards from ServiceNow Regional sales and delivery presence across most of the globe Whether clients are considering a standard ITSM replacement or embarking on an end-to-end digital transformation, ServiceNow is the dominant solution in the market. The foundation of any client's investment in ServiceNow is licensing for the platform, along with additional modules or capabilities. There are hundreds of ServiceNow partners globally, which creates an extremely complex landscape for clients who want a single partner to procure their licenses as well as deliver their professional services. DXC offers an industry-leading set of solutions with the competitive pricing and flexibility demanded by enterprise clients. We offer the lowest pricing, most flexible contract terms, and significant influence on ServiceNow's roadmap for platform enhancements.

The second solution concerns manufacturing in general: the Compliance Data Exchange (CDX) system, which generalizes this approach to a wider scope of industries and regulations The IMDS solution provides a venue for information exchange between car manufacturers and their suppliers (and their suppliers' suppliers) about the materials used in all the components of a vehicle. Automotive OEMs need to be compliant and save considerable amounts of money for non-compliance with existing regulations Type approval for new car models depends on the material compliance data available through IMDS Reducing the risk of non-compliance is essential for staying on the market Product recall costs are minimized by data collection and documentation in IMDS With the same background of legal requirements for other manufacturing industries, CDX helps companies systematically create, receive, and evaluate material information from their supply chain to comply with hazardous materials regulations. Both data collection and analysis are offered in a standardized way, providing an efficient and low-cost solution to the OEMs in manufacturing while keeping intellectual property secure. Electronics manufacturers needs to be compliant concerning RoHS/REACH/Conflict Minerals in order to stay on the market Comprehensive IT solutions—Both DXC Material Data Compliance solutions are comprehensive IT solutions that effectively meet global regulatory requirements.2.3. Basic functionalities are free—DXC Material Data Compliance service is with basic functions free for the suppliers; premium functionality is offered at attractive price levels. The price for special modules like Conflict Minerals Reporting is based on fixed-price per calendar year. Global availability—Both offering solutions provide global availability and around-the-clock operations. Software-as-a-Service—IMDS and CDX solutions are offered as Software-as-a-Service and do not require hardware or software investment. Interface solutions—Additionally, interface solutions to other systems are offered (e.g., clients' in-house systems) as well as to existing standard solutions. Import and export of Excel-based EICC-GeSI-compliant reports are supported, which eliminates rewrites. IMDS users include 40 well-known automotive OEMs representing more than 60 different brands of vehicles All tiers of automotive suppliers use IMDS—anyone in the supply chain with internet access In 17+ years of operation, 335,000+ users in 130,000+companies have registered in IMDS generating more than 50 million data sheets (numbers from July 2018) Experience with IMDS led to the development of the manufacturing solution CDX Meeting international regulatory requirements prevents organizations from penalties Requesting and evaluating information on materials from the supply chain is essential to an organization's efficiency and quality. It's also vital to managing and reporting hazardous substances, which are required to meet legal requirements that vary by region and country.

An increase in turnover involves a new approach to sustainability. Minimizing disposal risks with adequate documentation and avoiding problematic product contents help ensure a positive corporate image and stable brand value. IMDS is paid for by the automobile industry OEMs and is free for the suppliers. A standard CDX deal uses a pay-per-data volume model with standardized terms of service—no multimillion-dollar integration project.

Learn more about these services: Access additional offering content through the Related Assets. DXC Digital Design and Development addresses the full software development lifecycle from ideation through application deployment with a focus on creating enhanced user experiences and fast-cycle development of prototypes and MVPs as deployable working software. DXC uses advanced development methods ranging from model-driven software development to crowdsourcing to reimagine UX/UI experiences and to develop high-in-demand digital applications such as cloud native apps, mobile, Web, IoT, and blockchain applications, microservices, APIs, and more. Digital Design and Development consists of three key services: Rapid Digital Delivery (RDD) is the digital fast lane for application innovation. It is an advanced software development method to design, develop, and test applications through crowdsourcing. RDD's access to more than 1 million resources delivers value to clients quickly and more cost effectively, focusing on UX/UI, and digital apps such as chatbots, mobile and Web apps, IoT and Blockchain MVPs. Agile Applications Development provides the capability and scale to consistently build and implement secure applications with quality and speed. Using proven and repeatable Agile frameworks, DXC partners with clients to accelerate value realization, achieve predictable delivery, and drive collaboration across business and IT functions. Cloud Native Applications Development Services (CNAD) accelerates development of scalable cloud native applications and microservices using a factory approach while leveraging proven pre-built services from DXC and our partners. CNAD drives business agility and digitization by developing feature-rich and secure business apps. DXC Digital Design and Development Services enable traditional enterprises to operate like startups and develop great software. With Rapid Digital Delivery, DXC can provide MVPs in weeks as opposed to months. Our industrialized Agile delivery model can reduce IT delivery cost by as much as 50 – 75 percent. Application containerization, lean start-up professional services and cloud native application development enrich user experience, accelerate business outcomes, and drive business savings. Experience and scale—DXC possesses an industrialized set of capabilities at scale across 28 delivery centers on four continents with more than 10,000 applications built/ transformed/migrated to the cloud. We have more than 30 years of experience helping organizations overcome cultural and skills barriers in large-scale transformation. We bring clients more than 3 years of crowdsourcing experience and our own IP and platform. Adaptive automation—We develop the most effective client-specific automation solution that maximizes quality and efficiency and is easily deployed through code. Our expertise in API-centric integration enables us to leverage our client's existing environment and maximize ROI. Human-centric design—Design thinking and user experience practices are embedded in our methodologies. This assists in operationalizing innovation and delivering accessible, hyperpersonal solutions to maximize the adoption, use and relevance of cross-platform solutions. Accelerated transformation—We use a proven and repeatable approach to transformation to quickly jump start and accelerate digitalization. We leverage the latest technology and apply Lean, Agile and DevOps components appropriately through transformation stages with careful consideration of the existing client environment. Reduced risk—Our intimate understanding of client environments de-risks application development and integration for our clients. Value management dashboards that provide predictive and prescriptive analytics complement our portfolio, program and project governance processes to amplify feedback, monitor value delivery, and provide guidance for relentless improvement and continuous business alignment. 50,000+ applications professionals serving 1,000+ clients worldwide 55+ years applications development experience Broad certification footprint: 2,000+ PMP, 9,000+ Agile/DevOps practitioners, 250+ Agile coaches 17 Global Delivery Centers worldwide CMMi L5/L3, ITIL, ISO20000, IT4IT certified services Delivered more than 40 projects and over 300 crowdsourcing challenges Many organizations look for ways to adopt more of a startup mentality in their more mature, established enterprise. That's because to thrive in the digital era, DXC tells our clients they must think and act like a startup, promoting a culture where fresh ideas and an open mind fuel application innovation. They need expertise and scale to develop and implement software solutions that address changing market conditions. Close collaboration between business and IT is also necessary to align solutions to business outcomes, especially in a multisupplier environment. Furthermore, driving efficiency and faster time to value requires close collaboration across different IT functions using Agile/DevOps practices.

Trusted advice, cost-efficient implementation and flexible governance maximize the value of digital solutions, enabling business agility and realization of the client's digital strategy. Using a global industrialized model reduces IT delivery cost by as much as 50 – 75 percent. Here are some examples: Accelerated time to value–DXC customized a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product for a large telecom service provider using a distributed Agile model. This resulted in a 12x reduction of deployment time, enabling faster product launch than competitors. Business agility–DXC used Agile practices for a law enforcement agency to manage changing requirements, completing 4x the original requirements with 50 percent of the original estimated budget. High-quality, market-relevant solutions–For a European bank and insurance broker, DXC used scaled Agile and DevOps, resulting in an 85 percent reduction in regression issues and with minimal defects reported by 700 users in the first week after go-live.

Our expertise in API-centric integration enables us to leverage your existing environment and maximize ROI. Human-centric design–Design thinking and user experience practices are embedded in our methodologies. This assists in operationalizing innovation and delivering accessible, hyper personal solutions to maximize the adoption, use, and relevance of cross-platform solutions Industrialized continuous delivery–Our industrialized delivery model employs the best talent, methodologies, tools, and industry assets in multiple geographies. This capability can be scaled and distributed to effectively align with business cycles and strategies. Continuous testing, end-to-end quality management, and collective ownership of security through the Agile/DevSecOps pipeline ensure continuous delivery of high-quality and secure solutions. Accelerated transformation–We use a proven and repeatable approach to transformation to quickly jump start and accelerate digitalization. We leverage the latest technology and apply Lean, Agile, and DevSecOps components appropriately through transformation stages with careful consideration of your existing environment. Responsive governance–Value management dashboards that provide predictive and prescriptive analytics complement our portfolio, program, and project governance processes to amplify feedback, monitor value delivery, and provide guidance for relentless improvement and continuous business alignment. Secure by design–DXC addresses application security early and continuously through every step of the lifecycle to develop a more secure application validated through our security testing services. Our approach reduces risk while enabling us to deliver more secure applications faster and more efficiently.

Trusted advice, cost-efficient implementation and flexible governance maximize the value of digital solutions, enabling business agility and realization of the client's digital strategy. Using a global industrialized model reduces IT delivery cost by as much as 50 – 75 percent. Here are some examples: Accelerated time to value–DXC customized a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product for a large telecom service provider using a distributed Agile model. This resulted in a 12x reduction of deployment time, enabling faster product launch than competitors. Business agility–DXC used Agile practices for a law enforcement agency to manage changing requirements, completing 4x the original requirements with 50 percent of the original estimated budget. High-quality, market-relevant solutions–For a European bank and insurance broker, DXC used scaled Agile and DevOps, resulting in an 85 percent reduction in regression issues and with minimal defects reported by 700 users in the first week after go-live. Adaptive automation–We develop the most effective client-specific automation solution that maximizes quality and efficiency and is easily deployed through code. Our expertise in API-centric integration enables us to leverage your existing environment and maximize ROI. Human-centric design–Design thinking and user experience practices are embedded in our methodologies. This assists in operationalizing innovation and delivering accessible, hyper personal solutions to maximize the adoption, use, and relevance of cross-platform solutions Industrialized continuous delivery–Our industrialized delivery model employs the best talent, methodologies, tools, and industry assets in multiple geographies. This capability can be scaled and distributed to effectively align with business cycles and strategies. Continuous testing, end-to-end quality management, and collective ownership of security through the Agile/DevSecOps pipeline ensure continuous delivery of high-quality and secure solutions. Accelerated transformation–We use a proven and repeatable approach to transformation to quickly jump start and accelerate digitalization. We leverage the latest technology and apply Lean, Agile, and DevSecOps components appropriately through transformation stages with careful consideration of your existing environment. Responsive governance–Value management dashboards that provide predictive and prescriptive analytics complement our portfolio, program, and project governance processes to amplify feedback, monitor value delivery, and provide guidance for relentless improvement and continuous business alignment. Secure by design–DXC addresses application security early and continuously through every step of the lifecycle to develop a more secure application validated through our security testing services. Our approach reduces risk while enabling us to deliver more secure applications faster and more efficiently.

          "page_body": "DXC Managed Mainframe Services provide clients operation and support of IBM z/Series mainframe platform including hosting, storage, and disaster recovery. Services range from client-dedicated installations to highly leveraged, shared environments. We deliver global services remotely to client sites or DXC leveraged data centers. A flexible service design offers base services including mainframe and storage platform, operating system, operational support tools, and 24x7 management. ITIL-based service management enables clients to meet operational industry standards and our stringent security policies. Optional features include site migration, transformation, non-base software support, and flexible pricing based on used or installed million instructions per second (MIPS). We help clients optimize mainframe service costs and enhance productivity by delivering the management expertise, processes, and tools to scale Mainframe infrastructure. This allows clients to meet organizational and market changes without incurring capital investment. Performance improvement — A public sector agency gained operational and performance benefits from a new platform-as-a-service that improved transaction volumes ten-fold and response times by 97%. The platform also  reduced the risk of outages and service disruptions resulting from additional capacity.  Savings — A large multinational automotive manufacturer selected DXC for a multi-year infrastructure outsourcing contract to lower total cost of ownership by up to 30% with less risk than other competitors. Fast provisioning resulted  in a savings of $1.3 million.  Growth and scalability — DXC helped a major insurance company grow from a regional to national provider by enabling stable applications, mainframe operations, and resource flexibility. The result was a robust, flexible technology  environment that supports the company’s growth goals and reduced IT costs by 50% in five years.  Expertise — Offers in-depth z/OS, IMS, DB2, CICS, and MQ-Series experience. DXC has a global pool of talent consisting of on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore resources. Our talent comes from companies that have previously outsourced for HPE, EDS, and CSC and from talent hired from the external market. Our skills are organized and trained in a manner that allows efficiency and constant training through our Academies. In addition to our managed-services delivery organization, DXC has additional consultancy skills in Application modernization and digital transformation, performance engineering, systems management, and emerging technologies such as BigData and Analytics, Cognitive, Security and Compliance and Cloud/Hybrid Computing. Success — Global reach with many years of Infrastructure and Application Mainframe experience. DXC manages 720,000+ mainframe MIPS for 160+ clients in 14 countries; 150+ Mainframe Application Management clients; Conducted over 300 successful mainframe migrations to date. Responsiveness — Supports z/OS, TPF, zLinux, VM/VSE, non-IBM, and 24x7 operations. Thought leadership — Uses DXC knowledge to reposition IT as a strategic investment, rather than an operational cost. Innovation — Pioneered the first mainframe outsourcing model in 1962; established the first regional datacenter in 1970 and European data centers in 1984.  DXC is focused on client business objectives and has a mass that is hard to ignore. It offers a full spectrum of DSO/HIMS capabilities and a global footprint to deliver on hybrid infrastructure services – legacy, private cloud and public cloud.6 DXC operates 33 Mainframes in ASIA/Pacific, comprising roughly 144,000 MIPS in the Asia/Pacific region. Of this, 109,000 are traditional IBM mainframe MIPS, 6,000 are cloud-based IBM MIPS and 29,000 are MIPS from non-IBM mainframes. Reference clients report DXC's mainframe services are very good. DXC offers both traditional managed mainframe services and the ability to run mainframe on the cloud.7 The combined strength of CSC and HPE ES means DXC has more than 95 data centers, more the 250 leading partners and more than 14 strategic partners. With all this, DXC has capabilities and global footprint to offer a full spectrum of hybrid infrastructure services – legacy, private cloud and public cloud.8 Reference clients praise DXC for its global scale and resource pool, and for its technical capabilities and strategic vendor relationships. They also appreciate DXC's focus on service management and traditional DCMSs.8 6 Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Data Center Outsourcing and Hybrid Infrastructure Managed Services, North America, 18 June 2018 7 Gartner, Critical Capabilities for Data Center Outsourcing and Hybrid Infrastructure Managed Services, Asia Pacific, 22 August 2018 8 Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Data Center Outsourcing and Hybrid Infrastructure Managed Services, Europe, 14 June 2018 Many enterprises are facing a growing challenge of depending on mainframes for secure, reliable and heavy-volume data processing while trying to manage costs of the in-house environment. It takes ongoing investment in software, hardware, facilities, and  support. In addition, capacity must be readily available to handle peak periods and unexpected growth. As the volume of transactions is increasing with more consumer-driven demands for information, more and more CIOs/CTOs are looking for someone to  help them navigate these infrastructure challenges. Implementation — Average migration/transition time is six to eight months  Deal length — Average contract length is five to seven years  TCV — low-end starts at $20 million; consider workloads from 80 to 6000 MIPS or higher  Pricing models — calculated on base offering and uplifts selected; whether customer or DXC managed; time and materials  Regional availability — offering is available worldwide with services delivered from DXC Regional Centers  CLIENT REGION INDUSTRY CLOSED/WON  Commonwealth Bank ANZ Banking & Capital Markets Aug 2017 Rolls Royce UKIIMEA Manufacturing May 2017 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp AMS Banking & Capital Markets Nov 2017 Zurich Insurance AMS, UIKKMEA, NC EUR Insurance Jul 2017 London Markets UKIIMEA Insurance Oct 2017 Education Testing Services AMS Consumer Industries & Retail Nov 2017 BAe Systems UKIIMEA Manufacturing Feb 2019 The Nielsen Company AMS Consumer Industries & Retail Jun 2017 Perspecta AMS Public Sector May 2018 Toyota (Canada) AMS Travel, Transportation & Hospitality Mar 2017 Blue Cross & Blue Shield MASS AMS Healthcare & Life Sciences Dec 2017 General Electric Capital Corporation AMS Banking & Capital Markets Sep 2017 Victoria Work Authority ANZ Insurance Jun 2018 Nissan North America Inc.

It takes ongoing investment in software, hardware, facilities, and  support. In addition, capacity must be readily available to handle peak periods and unexpected growth. As the volume of transactions is increasing with more consumer-driven demands for information, more and more CIOs/CTOs are looking for someone to  help them navigate these infrastructure challenges. Implementation — Average migration/transition time is six to eight months  Deal length — Average contract length is five to seven years  TCV — low-end starts at $20 million; consider workloads from 80 to 6000 MIPS or higher  Pricing models — calculated on base offering and uplifts selected; whether customer or DXC managed; time and materials  Regional availability — offering is available worldwide with services delivered from DXC Regional Centers  CLIENT REGION INDUSTRY CLOSED/WON  Commonwealth Bank ANZ Banking & Capital Markets Aug 2017 Rolls Royce UKIIMEA Manufacturing May 2017 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp AMS Banking & Capital Markets Nov 2017 Zurich Insurance AMS, UIKKMEA, NC EUR Insurance Jul 2017 London Markets UKIIMEA Insurance Oct 2017 Education Testing Services AMS Consumer Industries & Retail Nov 2017 BAe Systems UKIIMEA Manufacturing Feb 2019 The Nielsen Company AMS Consumer Industries & Retail Jun 2017 Perspecta AMS Public Sector May 2018 Toyota (Canada) AMS Travel, Transportation & Hospitality Mar 2017 Blue Cross & Blue Shield MASS AMS Healthcare & Life Sciences Dec 2017 General Electric Capital Corporation AMS Banking & Capital Markets Sep 2017 Victoria Work Authority ANZ Insurance Jun 2018 Nissan North America Inc.

          "page_body": "DXC GDPR Services for Oracle offers a solution for personal details held in Oracle applications to support compliance with the 2018 GDPR requirements. To address the expected growth in demand from individuals to know what of their personal details are held by organizations following the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in May 2018, DXC has developed a “Personal Details  Report” that can be run on demand to extract relevant data from the core Oracle applications. This is extendible to include data held in user defined fields, custom tables and industry-specific or specialized modules within the wider suite of  applications, subject to engaging with DXC’s Oracle Consulting and Advisory services. The introduction of GDPR in May 2018 has placed a burden on all organizations holding or processing personal data to demonstrate that these details are accurate and only being held for the purposes to which the individual consented. GDPR compliance support — DXC’s “Personal Details Report” contributes the demonstration of regulation compliance by showing that a process has been put in place and that a high volume of requests for personal data can be responded to within 30 days. Automation and standardization — Automation of reporting process produces consistent results and minimizes the amount of manual intervention required to produce the reports, as well as reducing the need to recruit additional staff to support the new regulations. Rapid and quick reporting — Running large numbers of reports during working hours can impact system performance as it copes with high traffic volumes across the network and then processing power required to generate the reports. Scheduling this activity for off peak periods minimizes these impacts but leaves the option to run on demand if/when required. Customer satisfaction — A quick response to the data request will engender a positive feeling to the responding organization and enhance customer relations. Partner alliance — DXC has been an Oracle partner for over 30 years. Currently a Platinum Partner and Cloud Select Partner and part of the Oracle Cloud Excellence Implementer (CEI) program. Expert Oracle capability — DXC has a global team of 9,000+ certified Oracle experts to advise, deliver and support Oracle solutions. Comprehensive — DXC offers a comprehensive GDPR solution for Oracle including the Oracle Fusion Middleware and application tool kits. Speed to value — Our preconfigured DXC Oracle Toolkit includes questionnaires, configuration workbooks, test scripts and automation, and provides a consistent, repeatable approach to accelerate cloud migration and deliver business results in weeks, not months. End-to-end solution — DXC has a complete range of specialized capabilities including Security, Digital Transformation, Consulting and Business Process Services to compliment the Oracle capabilities. It is currently developing a GDPR centralized solution to monitor and coordinate changes in and between systems and produce audit information. DXC has all the Oracle skills required to support your organization in building GDPR compliance into your business processes: Oracle Partner for 30+ years  9000+ Oracle certified resources.  Comprehensive offering including DXC resources specialized in Security, Analytics & Data Management, Integration, etc.  Strong partnerships with third-party organizations to provide comprehensive and niche solutions Organizations need to be more accountable for the security, accuracy and relevance of personal data held. The GDPR regulation increases the access rights of data subjects to their data on request, and to receive it in an acceptable time and format or  have it “forgotten.” Organizations must demonstrate that they have acted on these requests in a timely fashion.

          "full_body": "gdpr, general data protection regulations, oracle, oracle applications, compliance DXC GDPR Services for Oracle offers a solution for personal details held in Oracle applications to support compliance with the 2018 GDPR requirements. DXC GDPR Services for Oracle offers a solution for personal details held in Oracle applications to support compliance with the 2018 GDPR requirements. To address the expected growth in demand from individuals to know what of their personal details are held by organizations following the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in May 2018, DXC has developed a “Personal Details  Report” that can be run on demand to extract relevant data from the core Oracle applications. This is extendible to include data held in user defined fields, custom tables and industry-specific or specialized modules within the wider suite of  applications, subject to engaging with DXC’s Oracle Consulting and Advisory services. The introduction of GDPR in May 2018 has placed a burden on all organizations holding or processing personal data to demonstrate that these details are accurate and only being held for the purposes to which the individual consented. GDPR compliance support — DXC’s “Personal Details Report” contributes the demonstration of regulation compliance by showing that a process has been put in place and that a high volume of requests for personal data can be responded to within 30 days. Automation and standardization — Automation of reporting process produces consistent results and minimizes the amount of manual intervention required to produce the reports, as well as reducing the need to recruit additional staff to support the new regulations. Rapid and quick reporting — Running large numbers of reports during working hours can impact system performance as it copes with high traffic volumes across the network and then processing power required to generate the reports. Scheduling this activity for off peak periods minimizes these impacts but leaves the option to run on demand if/when required. Customer satisfaction — A quick response to the data request will engender a positive feeling to the responding organization and enhance customer relations. Partner alliance — DXC has been an Oracle partner for over 30 years. Currently a Platinum Partner and Cloud Select Partner and part of the Oracle Cloud Excellence Implementer (CEI) program. Expert Oracle capability — DXC has a global team of 9,000+ certified Oracle experts to advise, deliver and support Oracle solutions. Comprehensive — DXC offers a comprehensive GDPR solution for Oracle including the Oracle Fusion Middleware and application tool kits. Speed to value — Our preconfigured DXC Oracle Toolkit includes questionnaires, configuration workbooks, test scripts and automation, and provides a consistent, repeatable approach to accelerate cloud migration and deliver business results in weeks, not months. End-to-end solution — DXC has a complete range of specialized capabilities including Security, Digital Transformation, Consulting and Business Process Services to compliment the Oracle capabilities. It is currently developing a GDPR centralized solution to monitor and coordinate changes in and between systems and produce audit information. DXC has all the Oracle skills required to support your organization in building GDPR compliance into your business processes: Oracle Partner for 30+ years  9000+ Oracle certified resources.  Comprehensive offering including DXC resources specialized in Security, Analytics & Data Management, Integration, etc.  Strong partnerships with third-party organizations to provide comprehensive and niche solutions Organizations need to be more accountable for the security, accuracy and relevance of personal data held. The GDPR regulation increases the access rights of data subjects to their data on request, and to receive it in an acceptable time and format or  have it “forgotten.” Organizations must demonstrate that they have acted on these requests in a timely fashion. The consequences are significant fines of up to Euro 20 million or 4% of global turnover, whichever is the larger.

          "page_body": "DXC Data Center Recovery Services (DCRS) is a comprehensive highly cost-effective disaster recovery solution for midrange and mainframe environments. The solution greatly reduces or eliminates recovery time in the event of unplanned downtime or disaster. Utilizing leveraged or dedicated equipment from data centers geographically separated from clients business operations and supported by DXC's experienced recovery personnel we can help clients manage their business risks and reduce the impact from outages or disasters. An optional service is also available for the recovery of workplace and office environments. DCRS solutions support flexible contracting and invoicing terms, are customizable to meet the clients specific continuity requirements and are delivered from a global network of DXC Recovery Centers. Most enterprises rely on an ecosystem of internal and external systems and data to conduct their business. Users across the value chain are generating unprecedented amounts of data, and their expectation for services that are “always-on, always available” is the expected norm. Data Center Recovery Services provide clients with proactive strategies that are unique for their flexibility, global coverage, and ability to handle today's complex environments. Effective cost-saving recovery—A U.S. public sector agency reduced its IT costs by 20%, improved system availability, and reliability with zero severity 1 or 2 outages, and ensured system redundancy with near-100% network uptime. Optimized recovery times—A manufacturer of water heating systems implemented a cost-effective disaster recovery (DR) solution to protect its IT-enabled business processes and improve DR metrics significantly: recovery time objective (RTO) of 36 hours (previously 5 days), recovery point objective (RPO) of 24 hours, and only one DR rehearsal per year. Audit compliance and risk management—Compliance with stricter banking rules enabled one client to ensure a near zero failure rate, improved access to data, and always-on disaster protection. Data Center Recovery Services provided resumption of customer production environments inline with business requirements and service level objectives.  Customer choice—Solutions aligned to the business criticality of client workloads, supported globally, with the capability to integrate across traditional IT, cloud, and hybrid environments. No competitor provides the breadth of offerings and global reach.  Low risk—Strict limits on the number of clients assigned to the same leveraged asset. Our ratio of clients to hardware is 15:1; our competitors use much higher ratios with many having unlimited assignments. Also, the same equipment is not assigned to multiple clients within a defined geographical radius, something not offered by other providers.  Proven success—Thirty years of experience providing continuity solutions with the successful delivery of over 1000 disaster declarations with 100% success rate.  Market recognition—Gartner has position DXC Technology as a Leader in their report, Magic Quadrant for Data Center Outsourcing and Hybrid Infrastructure Managed Services, North America and Europe (2018).  Full lifecycle support—Expertise supporting the design, transformation, and management of continuity solutions, including advisory and transformation consulting, infrastructure build and implementation, and continuity program management. Competitors do not provide the spectrum of support related to the design, transformation, and management of business systems./li>  Over 30 years of experience in Data Center Recovery Services  33 Recovery Centers in 17 countries Recognized “Leader” in Gartner Magic Quadrant Recognized “Leader” in the Forrester Wave reports on DR service providers  Recognized “Strong Performer” in the Forrester Wave report on DraaS  100% success rate for 1,000+ disaster declarations Continuity challenges Although many companies have little tolerance for an outage or downtime, businesses struggle to create effective recovery plans for standard and complex operations with a strong ROI including support for complex business recovery. Although businesses want fast recovery times, minimal data loss, and the ability to comply with regulations, few will be equipped to ensure speed if proactive planning is not in place.

          "full_body": "Data Center Recovery Services, DCRS, Data, Recovery, Data Management, Risk Management, DXC Recovery Center DXC Data Center Recovery Services is a comprehensive, highly cost-effective disaster recovery solution for midrange and mainframe environments. DXC Data Center Recovery Services (DCRS) is a comprehensive highly cost-effective disaster recovery solution for midrange and mainframe environments. The solution greatly reduces or eliminates recovery time in the event of unplanned downtime or disaster. Utilizing leveraged or dedicated equipment from data centers geographically separated from clients business operations and supported by DXC's experienced recovery personnel we can help clients manage their business risks and reduce the impact from outages or disasters. An optional service is also available for the recovery of workplace and office environments. DCRS solutions support flexible contracting and invoicing terms, are customizable to meet the clients specific continuity requirements and are delivered from a global network of DXC Recovery Centers. Most enterprises rely on an ecosystem of internal and external systems and data to conduct their business. Users across the value chain are generating unprecedented amounts of data, and their expectation for services that are “always-on, always available” is the expected norm. Data Center Recovery Services provide clients with proactive strategies that are unique for their flexibility, global coverage, and ability to handle today's complex environments. Effective cost-saving recovery—A U.S. public sector agency reduced its IT costs by 20%, improved system availability, and reliability with zero severity 1 or 2 outages, and ensured system redundancy with near-100% network uptime. Optimized recovery times—A manufacturer of water heating systems implemented a cost-effective disaster recovery (DR) solution to protect its IT-enabled business processes and improve DR metrics significantly: recovery time objective (RTO) of 36 hours (previously 5 days), recovery point objective (RPO) of 24 hours, and only one DR rehearsal per year. Audit compliance and risk management—Compliance with stricter banking rules enabled one client to ensure a near zero failure rate, improved access to data, and always-on disaster protection. Data Center Recovery Services provided resumption of customer production environments inline with business requirements and service level objectives.  Customer choice—Solutions aligned to the business criticality of client workloads, supported globally, with the capability to integrate across traditional IT, cloud, and hybrid environments. No competitor provides the breadth of offerings and global reach.  Low risk—Strict limits on the number of clients assigned to the same leveraged asset. Our ratio of clients to hardware is 15:1; our competitors use much higher ratios with many having unlimited assignments. Also, the same equipment is not assigned to multiple clients within a defined geographical radius, something not offered by other providers.  Proven success—Thirty years of experience providing continuity solutions with the successful delivery of over 1000 disaster declarations with 100% success rate.  Market recognition—Gartner has position DXC Technology as a Leader in their report, Magic Quadrant for Data Center Outsourcing and Hybrid Infrastructure Managed Services, North America and Europe (2018).  Full lifecycle support—Expertise supporting the design, transformation, and management of continuity solutions, including advisory and transformation consulting, infrastructure build and implementation, and continuity program management. Competitors do not provide the spectrum of support related to the design, transformation, and management of business systems./li>  Over 30 years of experience in Data Center Recovery Services  33 Recovery Centers in 17 countries Recognized “Leader” in Gartner Magic Quadrant Recognized “Leader” in the Forrester Wave reports on DR service providers  Recognized “Strong Performer” in the Forrester Wave report on DraaS  100% success rate for 1,000+ disaster declarations Continuity challenges Although many companies have little tolerance for an outage or downtime, businesses struggle to create effective recovery plans for standard and complex operations with a strong ROI including support for complex business recovery. Although businesses want fast recovery times, minimal data loss, and the ability to comply with regulations, few will be equipped to ensure speed if proactive planning is not in place.

This deep expertise, along with years of experience  implementing ITAM and ITOM solutions on ServiceNow, has taught us valuable lessons and proven methodologies to make clients’ service asset and configuration management (SACM) journeys succeed. DXC offers a best practice prescriptive roadmap  to maturity as well as flexible service configurations that meet clients’ business requirements. DXC’s robust process collateral, preconfigured technical solutions and collaborative implementation methodology can help clients achieve unprecedented  speed and value for their DXC IT Asset and Operations Management for ServiceNow Implementations. Organizations face growing digital complexity with increased use of cloud and mobile infrastructure platforms. An ever-growing number of connected devices, increased security risks and the need to manage compliance emphasizes the importance of having  mature processes more than ever. DXC IT Asset and Operations Management for ServiceNow provides quick wins as well as a strategic roadmap for addressing these challenges, increasing maturity and harnessing the power of the ServiceNow platform. DXC’s  experience, mature processes and best practice solutions can help transform organizations and lead clients on the path to service transparency and asset optimization. Improve control — DXC helped a pharmaceutical company align ITAM processes across five global regions, rationalize a multitude of data sources and standardize disparate regional data models. This led to streamlined operations,  global reporting transparency and improved governance for processes and data.  Reduce cost — A global retailer was spending staggering amounts on expired lease payments due to poor visibility and process inefficiencies. DXC implemented a solution that enabled proactive tracking of leased assets and contracts  with notification and workflow to drive end-of-life and return processes. At the enterprise level, this solution resulted in significant hard-dollar savings on a recurring basis.  Get compliant — After a recently failed audit, a nationally ranked university addressed their asset management immaturity by rapidly implementing foundational processes along with an integrated CMDB. This provided transparency  into tracking hardware and software, shedding light on non-compliant assets in the environment. DXC’s roadmap to SACM maturity has provided them a guided path for continued growth.  End-to-end capability — DXC’s deep ITAM and ITOM process optimization experience and ServiceNow solutions to bring hard-dollar savings to organizations.  Best practices — DXC has prebuilt best practice processes and solutions provided as part of accelerated implementations or leveraged through bespoke implementations.  Speed — Standard deployment time is reduced by up to 6 months using DXC’s best-in-industry ITAM accelerator, while providing a higher level of process and tool maturity.  Lifecycle — DXC is a one-stop shop for all ServiceNow needs – licensing, implementation services, run support and strategic guidance.  Technology — As a leading IT services provider, DXC offers more IT services #1 ServiceNow ecosystem provider Highest customer satisfaction score of all globally certified partners 3300+ successful ServiceNow implementations 700+ certified implementation consultants Recognized with multiple top awards from ServiceNow Many organizations have some level of IT asset and operations in place but lack the needed maturity to grow and optimize their systems and processes to meet demands of the business at scale. Businesses look to IT to provide more services, faster and cheaper. IT must shift its focus to a clearly defined service-oriented culture. Equally important, IT organizations need visibility into hardware and software components that comprise the service to maximize service availability, accelerate service delivery and optimize costs. Implementation — Project-based engagements typically last 2-6 months, depending on scope of work and additional configurations and integrations. Multi-phase implementations can span 12-18 months or more, depending on breadth of business objectives.

Nearly 80% of the world's financial firms use DXC for security. Identity and Access Management (IAM) is one of the most complex areas in security today as it plays a major role in every aspect of the business. User identities are a fundamental part of controlling access, proving compliance, and managing risk and therefore it is one of the most necessary investments organizations make. With the demand for emerging technologies, changes in threat landscape, and staying on top of data access needs, IAM can be difficult to manage and maintain. The way organizations conduct business is changing rapidly. Smartphones and tablets have replaced desktops. Users no longer work at desks; they work from home, a restaurant, and even the supermarket. Users access company applications remotely, and company data is no longer stored on premise, but rather in the cloud. The result: people need access to information from anywhere at any time. To keep up with changing business demands, IT and security controls must be agile—fitting business needs—while protecting valuable company resources. The market is expanding and solutions are adapting to fit the current needs. Implementation time varies depending on the complexity of the target applications, business workflow and planned phases, which typically take 5 to 12 months. The implementation of the base scope document that supports 4-5 applications (Workday, Active Directory, Office365, Exchange) without complexity is approximately 4 months. The pricing model is based on a one-time implementation charge, while monthly support charges are determined by the number of identities (employees, contractors) and selected service options. Deal sizes range from small volumes (1500) to large environments (>100K identities) Annual deal values can range from $300,000 to $2,000,000 Most contract terms are 36-60 months in duration      CLIENT   REGION   INDUSTRY   CLOSED/WON        Daimler AG   N.C.

DXC Threat and Vulnerability Advisory Services DXC Cyber Attack Simulation DXC Vulnerability Scanning DXC Vulnerability Intelligence Service The DXC Ethical Hacking and Vulnerability Management offering identifies, manages and mitigates weaknesses in your defenses before adversaries can attack. It does so by testing an organization's defense posture and developing vulnerability identification plans that uncover weaknesses. Services supporting this offering include Threat and Vulnerability managed and advisory services, Applications Security Services, Cyber Attack Simulation, Vulnerability Management and Vulnerability Intelligence. The difficulty for businesses today is to understand what vulnerabilities are present and how impactful they are to the business. The DXC Ethical Hacking and Vulnerability Management team have a broad set of skills in all areas of security. Our dedicated penetration testing team can deliver anything from targeted penetration testing to a full blown cyber attack assessment. The cyber attack assessment is the first step to identifying where areas of weakness are in a customer's security posture. Use the output of a cyber attack assessment to help in defining an end to end approach to security. DXC can help define and deploy a vulnerability management solution (whether via MSS or advisory) to ensure full visibility of all network connected assets and identify whether any vulnerabilities exist that need to be addressed, and to have a view of any changes within the customer network whether authorized or not. Regional delivery capabilities ensure support your security program within region. Advisory Services DXC delivers expert assessment of the vulnerabilities that open clients' information technology (IT) systems to attackers. Our reach, scale, and access to cutting-edge research enable clients to counter global threats and vulnerabilities. Long-standing clients trust DXC to handle sensitive data according to industry best practices. Prioritize resources—DXC conducted a high-level gap analysis to ISO 27001 standards for a university that experienced over 9000 unknown devices connecting to its network annually. This enabled the university to prioritize IT resources to efficiently achieve its security and business objectives. International scale—When a U.K.-based law firm opened offices in Asia, its small IT department needed help to ensure their data security across the globe. DXC supported the build-out of a secure, global infrastructure. Industry-aligned expertise—DXC enabled a multinational travel reservations company to secure remote and Internet access for 500,000 roaming endpoints, shared kiosks, and handheld devices while achieving cost savings over the legacy network topology. Managed Security Services Proactive protection—Assessments reveal vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities threaten security. Compromised security leads to costly breaches. Avoid this path with Vulnerability Scanning, which proactively prevents threats before they impact clients' operations. Fewer attacks—When combined with Security Monitoring, Vulnerability Scanning automatically correlates security events with scan data. The enriched information provides further context that improves threat management and thwarts future attacks. Visibility and control—With the self-service portal, clients gain an integrated view of their risk posture and 24/7 access to vulnerability and threat data, incidents, and change requests. Reduced complexity—Global security experts help clients understand and prioritize vulnerabilities, control IT risk, and prevent attackers from leaking valuable information. Cost savings—Clients do not incur CapEx costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of an on-premise scanning infrastructure while also avoiding costly breaches due to devastating disruptions. Advisory Services The DXC Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) team is a unique, global team with a vast depth and breadth of experience in security testing, backed by one of the largest information security specialist teams in the world. The TVM practice offers a variety of specialist security services including penetration testing, threat intelligence, and vulnerability management. Ethical hacking experts—Accredited to the highest government and industry standards, including Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST) and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certifications. Local presence, global scale—Specialized security advisors with local presence and knowledge but who can deliver TVM services on a global scale. Vulnerability Management (VM) specialists design, implement, pilot, and operate customized VM solutions. Industry-standards—Industry recognized methodology for handling customer data (ISO 27001, ISO 9001). End-to-end protection—Real-world cyber-attack simulations use multiple methods and tools to exploit weaknesses in people, process, and technology security in the same way that real attackers do. Detailed remediation advice—DXC advisors provide recommendations on how to resolve the identified security issues to ensure that key assets are protected. Managed Security Services Suite of integrated services—DXC offers comprehensive diagnostic, advisory, and managed services, which address all areas of the vulnerability management life cycle including discovery, assessment, reporting, prioritization, remediation, and verification. Prioritized risks—Vulnerability Scanning automatically prioritizes security monitoring incidents and provides additional context during incident analysis and investigation by correlating vulnerability and asset information with threat data. Instant analytics—With VS, clients can search security data, view trends, and track the status of their security posture 24/7 using the unified customer portal, a feature of the next generation MSS platform from which VS is delivered. Understanding of clients' businesses—DXC understands business processes, networks, and IT environments due to deep customer knowledge gleaned from decades of delivering vulnerability and threat management services. Cloud-based value—Clients gain immediate value using DXC's managed cloud service, which enables quick service implementation, unlimited scanning, and flexible, usage-based service options for every business need. DXC has over 3,500 global security advisory, transformation, and managed security services professionals; 40+ years of experience delivering managed security services; and 20 years of experience advising clients. DXC's ethical hacking experts are accredited according to the highest government and industry standards, including the Council for Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST) and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) qualifications. DXC advisors have a minimum of five to ten years of experience at the highest security levels. DXC's proprietary threat intelligence allows us to deliver realistic simulation attacks to emulate the threat actor that concerns your organization most. DXC is vendor agnostic, which means we are not limited by any one technology but can work with best-in-class technology providers to deliver optimal security results. Without a sound security program, companies often experience game-changing losses when vulnerabilities are exposed by hackers or disgruntled employees. The resulting data breaches damage brands and reputations, which are difficult to repair in a highly competitive marketplace. Add lost intellectual property fines and hefty remediation costs, and the results of a cyber attack can be catastrophic. DXC can provide a full breakdown of a business's vulnerabilities and where areas of weak security could be improved. DXC can provide an ongoing vulnerability management program whether part of a managed service or completely bespoke. Let DXC test your security as a dedicated attacker would to identify gaps and help define your managed security requirements.

DXC Threat and Vulnerability Advisory Services DXC Cyber Attack Simulation DXC Vulnerability Scanning DXC Vulnerability Intelligence Service The DXC Ethical Hacking and Vulnerability Management offering identifies, manages and mitigates weaknesses in your defenses before adversaries can attack. It does so by testing an organization's defense posture and developing vulnerability identification plans that uncover weaknesses. Services supporting this offering include Threat and Vulnerability managed and advisory services, Applications Security Services, Cyber Attack Simulation, Vulnerability Management and Vulnerability Intelligence. The difficulty for businesses today is to understand what vulnerabilities are present and how impactful they are to the business. The DXC Ethical Hacking and Vulnerability Management team have a broad set of skills in all areas of security. Our dedicated penetration testing team can deliver anything from targeted penetration testing to a full blown cyber attack assessment. The cyber attack assessment is the first step to identifying where areas of weakness are in a customer's security posture. Use the output of a cyber attack assessment to help in defining an end to end approach to security. DXC can help define and deploy a vulnerability management solution (whether via MSS or advisory) to ensure full visibility of all network connected assets and identify whether any vulnerabilities exist that need to be addressed, and to have a view of any changes within the customer network whether authorized or not. Regional delivery capabilities ensure support your security program within region. Advisory Services DXC delivers expert assessment of the vulnerabilities that open clients' information technology (IT) systems to attackers. Our reach, scale, and access to cutting-edge research enable clients to counter global threats and vulnerabilities. Long-standing clients trust DXC to handle sensitive data according to industry best practices. Prioritize resources—DXC conducted a high-level gap analysis to ISO 27001 standards for a university that experienced over 9000 unknown devices connecting to its network annually. This enabled the university to prioritize IT resources to efficiently achieve its security and business objectives. International scale—When a U.K.-based law firm opened offices in Asia, its small IT department needed help to ensure their data security across the globe. DXC supported the build-out of a secure, global infrastructure. Industry-aligned expertise—DXC enabled a multinational travel reservations company to secure remote and Internet access for 500,000 roaming endpoints, shared kiosks, and handheld devices while achieving cost savings over the legacy network topology. Managed Security Services Proactive protection—Assessments reveal vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities threaten security. Compromised security leads to costly breaches. Avoid this path with Vulnerability Scanning, which proactively prevents threats before they impact clients' operations. Fewer attacks—When combined with Security Monitoring, Vulnerability Scanning automatically correlates security events with scan data. The enriched information provides further context that improves threat management and thwarts future attacks. Visibility and control—With the self-service portal, clients gain an integrated view of their risk posture and 24/7 access to vulnerability and threat data, incidents, and change requests. Reduced complexity—Global security experts help clients understand and prioritize vulnerabilities, control IT risk, and prevent attackers from leaking valuable information. Cost savings—Clients do not incur CapEx costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of an on-premise scanning infrastructure while also avoiding costly breaches due to devastating disruptions. Advisory Services The DXC Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) team is a unique, global team with a vast depth and breadth of experience in security testing, backed by one of the largest information security specialist teams in the world. The TVM practice offers a variety of specialist security services including penetration testing, threat intelligence, and vulnerability management.

Vulnerability Management (VM) specialists design, implement, pilot, and operate customized VM solutions. Industry-standards—Industry recognized methodology for handling customer data (ISO 27001, ISO 9001). End-to-end protection—Real-world cyber-attack simulations use multiple methods and tools to exploit weaknesses in people, process, and technology security in the same way that real attackers do. Detailed remediation advice—DXC advisors provide recommendations on how to resolve the identified security issues to ensure that key assets are protected. Managed Security Services Suite of integrated services—DXC offers comprehensive diagnostic, advisory, and managed services, which address all areas of the vulnerability management life cycle including discovery, assessment, reporting, prioritization, remediation, and verification. Prioritized risks—Vulnerability Scanning automatically prioritizes security monitoring incidents and provides additional context during incident analysis and investigation by correlating vulnerability and asset information with threat data. Instant analytics—With VS, clients can search security data, view trends, and track the status of their security posture 24/7 using the unified customer portal, a feature of the next generation MSS platform from which VS is delivered.

DXC's ethical hacking experts are accredited according to the highest government and industry standards, including the Council for Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST) and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) qualifications. DXC advisors have a minimum of five to ten years of experience at the highest security levels. DXC's proprietary threat intelligence allows us to deliver realistic simulation attacks to emulate the threat actor that concerns your organization most. DXC is vendor agnostic, which means we are not limited by any one technology but can work with best-in-class technology providers to deliver optimal security results. Without a sound security program, companies often experience game-changing losses when vulnerabilities are exposed by hackers or disgruntled employees. The resulting data breaches damage brands and reputations, which are difficult to repair in a highly competitive marketplace. Add lost intellectual property fines and hefty remediation costs, and the results of a cyber attack can be catastrophic. DXC can provide a full breakdown of a business's vulnerabilities and where areas of weak security could be improved. DXC can provide an ongoing vulnerability management program whether part of a managed service or completely bespoke. Let DXC test your security as a dedicated attacker would to identify gaps and help define your managed security requirements.

With data proliferating everywhere, encryption of data at rest and data on the move is a critical data security control in a multi-layer security strategy, to protect against data breaches, data misuse or accidental data loss. Industry standards, regulations and laws prescribe and/or strongly recommend data protection controls such as encryption, de-identification, pseudonymization, and tokenization of data at rest as well as secrets management to centrally manage and store credentials that provide access to sensitive data. Additionally, assuring digital identities, ensuring data integrity, monitoring data activity and securing data communications is a complex problem to solve in today's era of digital transformation. Organizations need help to identify and evaluate their data risks, develop appropriate policies, and implement processes and integrated technical controls to secure their critical data assets and mitigate security and compliance risks. With businesses migrating more production and critical workloads to the public cloud and adopting new application technologies such as containerisation, microservices, serverless computing, managing the data security lifecycle in a cost effective and efficient way is an essential component of any security program.

DXC consultants are vendor-certified and have a breadth and depth of expertise and knowledge of security technologies, with partners such as Symantec, McAfee, Microsoft, Crowdstrike, FireEye, Carbon Black and others. DXC supplies industry-certified professionals with extensive security and compliance expertise such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO27001, CISSP, SANS Institute, GIAC, as well as partner-specific accreditation including International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) membership and certifications. DXC Security consultants hold global IT and security certifications including CISSP, CISM, CISA, GIAC, ISO 27001 Lead Auditor, PCI QSA, and vendor-specific technology certifications Large installed base of 300+ customers Regional presence but global service able to address large global customers Strong alliances with leading technology vendors such as McAfee, Symantec, Microsoft, CheckPoint and Crowdstrike As organizational perimeters disappear, companies face new security challenges. Global workforces in all environments and industries require instant communication and remote productivity to keep that competitive edge. CISOs have to balance business needs and user productivity with the struggle to stay ahead of the cyber criminals and to protect sensitive data on users' devices. They must also address new and complex issues around compliance and regulations. In addition, the cyber threat landscape is rapidly growing and evolving. Attacks are more sophisticated and stealthy, and come from highly motivated, well-funded adversaries who are focused on acquiring valuable corporate data. Traditional security controls no longer protect against today's targeted attackers—organizations need a new security model that proactively uncovers the most advanced endpoint threats and provides the ability to respond immediately with thorough, dynamic analysis, investigation and remediation. Engagement details depend on selected services : MEP, LDE, MATP or METDR. Number of endpoints is a key cost driver, as well as selected service options and add-ons. One time implementation cost + monthly ongoing management cost.

Improve consumer engagement and reduce cost of care: Leveraging Health360 and integrating internet of things (IoT) devices to enable remote consumer monitoring and proactive telehealth support, Dartmouth-Hitchcock achieved a 36% reduction in total cost of care, 4 times the national health and wellness program engagement, 23% reduction in ER utilization and a 95% customer satisfaction rating. Reduce readmissions and deliver self-care: DXC implemented Health360 for Barnes Healthcare to remotely monitor, collect and analyze real-time consumer data, via mobile tablets, in order to help evaluate consumer readmission risk, and deliver self-care and other educational materials. Barnes now has the ability to evaluate consumer readmission risks, proactively monitor consumer data to identify potential condition exacerbations and deliver self-care. Quickly scale to the cloud: DXC implemented Health360 for Medibank for the private health fund’s chemotherapy at home program in New South Wales, Australia, and is now looking at the private hospital and public-sector markets in Australia and New Zealand to assist the local sector’s move to value-based care.

We are experienced in all types of loans, from the “prime of prime” to the “sub of sub-prime.” Financial organizations can latch onto a fixed set of functionalities and stay with it for a long time, simply due to reliability. As a result, the functionalities can become a set of “best practices.” Over time, pricing and processes can become rigid and static.

DXC Consumer Loan Processing delivers these outcomes: Reduced lending risk by improving policies, procedures, and content management Modern automation to drive compliance and consistency in business rules and increase data capture quality Improved speed to market by integrating systems, providing tools for faster decision-making, and building the ability to introduce new process more efficiently Enhanced customer service through digitization, validated by customer satisfaction metrics Turnkey, end-to-end solution — DXC can handle your entire loan servicing process, acquisition through liquidation, or assist with any part of the process.

Structuring operations to be agile and flexible: What areas can be updated to support a faster environment? Typical deal is a full BPO/BPS loan servicing opportunity. There is a one-time implementation fee. The fee includes any conversion from one system to the next.

          "page_body": "Hybrid IT Integration Solutions (HITS) provides a seamless integration between cloud consumption and ITIL practices, enabling the client's IT function to become a Cloud Service Broker (CSB) for their organization. With an aggregated self-service catalog for the customer's IT services and DXC-managed clouds (AWS, Azure, VMware/MSV), as well as customer managed private and/or public cloud and other service providers (i.e., network, storage, load balancers), HITS enables a client to become a broker of both customer and / or DXC managed hybrid services in a fully integrated solution. For higher level service offerings, such as a multi-tier application(s), HITS provides the ability to build catalog items that are provisioned across multiple cloud providers. Additionally, HITS provides automated governance of customer-defined corporate and regulatory policies to ensure compliance requirements can be met. The HITS solution is delivered as a DXC Managed Service with a consumption-based SaaS model (OPEX) and provides the additional benefit of visibility of spending across the services portfolio. For enterprises seeking to become a CSB to optimize their multi-cloud environment, DXC enables seamless integration between the customer's cloud consumption and ITSM processes on ServiceNow. Adopting a hybrid IT operating model to provide IT as a service can help enterprises mitigate ungoverned services consumption and control usage and costs of cloud services from multiple providers. The HITS managed service provides on-demand cloud services from a services catalog. The self-service user experience enables the client to order and manage subscriptions to cloud services from one place. With this single point of entry, IT gains visibility and control over the use of cloud services, while also reducing staff workload and optimizing the expenditure on cloud services. Increase business agility — HITS provide self-service, on-demand delivery of high-value services to the business.

To be successful, it is imperative that the CIOs control and reduce costs while improving/simplifying the customer experience, supporting fast innovation, and providing a consistent high-quality level of service and processes.

          "page_body": "SIAM 2.0 now available Obligation Tracking, a new feature in release 2.0, formalizes the process of ensuring that suppliers are performing the functions for which they are contracted. The release also features a modular consumption model that allows a client to start with the most urgent business disruptors, such as Critical Incident Management. This model aligns to the client's DXC Service Integration and Management maturity journey and provides a clear path to gaining control over their multi-supplier environment. Service Integration and Management (SIAM) is an essential component of the IT operating model for hybrid IT environments. Clients move to an IT operating model (ITOM) built to deliver faster, more reliable changes and higher efficiency. SIAM's transformational approach integrates, deploys, and manages services from multiple service providers. Our non-disruptive, multiphase approach uses industry standards including IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and a value-chain approach to the IT operating model (IT4IT). It also provides visibility, measures performance and deliverables, governs issue resolution and improves end-to-end performance. SIAM is available in multiple configurations aligned to client needs and includes advisory services and project expertise throughout the transformation process. As clients seek to adopt a more flexible, hybrid IT approach to succeed in the digital age, they are extending into cloud while retaining their traditional services. DXC SIAM helps clients control and manage the complexities of a hybrid environment that includes in-house IT, hardware vendors, and IT service providers. DXC SIAM provides a structured and integrated service delivery model that increases service delivery performance, implements industry best practices, and provides visibility across all service providers. It creates flexible IT service delivery with increased value and speed to the business. SIAM achieved the following results with a European banking customer: Create transformation roadmap – Facilitated the transformation to more mobile, digital technologies while managing a mix of hybrid cloud and traditional IT services and infrastructure Best of breed approach – Bank can now mix and match SaaS and other cloud-based applications based on their customer’s needs, with a best-of-breed approach to applications Drive service improvement – Managing end-to-end processes across their service providers and tracking overall performance and regulatory compliance. Automated and predictable – Offers a single-entry point for requesting a mix of IT services, ensuring these services are compliant and cost-effective, reducing manual IT tasks, increasing overall visibility, and streamlining approval and change management processes, resulting in automated and predictable provisioning. Expertise—Our experienced SIAM teams serve as the single point of escalation for the client's delivery issues, providing performance improvement and visibility across service providers, while managing and approving operational changes (adding or modifying infrastructure components or software across service providers). Transformation with minimal risk—Advisory and Transformation helps identify how to embark on the SIAM journey, while ensuring the maximum benefits with minimal risks. Scalability—We offer a range of options to meet the client's IT and financial objectives. We don't provide a “one-size-fits-all” approach because SIAM isn't simply categorized. DXC has helped our clients to gain the benefits of SIAM regardless of whether they wanted to build the capability on their own, co-source, or fully outsource to DXC. Adaptability across industries and geographies—Our SIAM service provides global reach and scale, suiting the client's demands across businesses, industries, regions and geographies—with in-country or in-region presence for regulatory drivers and compliance. Regulatory compliance—Our solutions are aligned to and even drive industry standards like ITIL and IT4IT, providing necessary safety according to client requirements. DXC has engaged with more than 30 of our top 200 enterprise accounts, managing an average of six primary outsourcing partners and 20+ secondary service providers. DXC delivers services to over 1,000 clients worldwide, including some of the world's largest enterprises and governments. DXC's IT Service Management (ITSM) expertise includes 4.4 million changes, incidents, and requests per month. DXC employs 12,000+ ITIL-certified professionals. Clients are spending time addressing operational topics, coordinating service providers, and fire-fighting rather than planning for business strategy and outcomes and continuous improvement programs. This challenge leads to the perception that IT is the problem. In reality, the service provider landscape in the hybrid IT environment is out-pacing the client's ability to provide services in an integrated way, resulting in low service quality, limited flexibility and ability, and increasing time-to-market. Implementation and Transition/Transformation time: Average T&T timeframe is typically phased. The initial implementation is within 5-6 months. The service provider onboarding follows this phase, and is evaluated on an individual basis. SIAM is typically a transformation project, with longer transition cycles. Deal value/size/length: Average deal $5M-$50M TCV, contract length 36 months (est. 4% to 8% of annual outsourcing budget) Regional factors: Global, all industry groups Pricing Model Options: the client can select which services are required based on modules and volumes      CLIENT   REGION   INDUSTRY   CLOSED/WON        apoBank   N.C.

DXC SIAM helps clients control and manage the complexities of a hybrid environment that includes in-house IT, hardware vendors, and IT service providers. DXC SIAM provides a structured and integrated service delivery model that increases service delivery performance, implements industry best practices, and provides visibility across all service providers. It creates flexible IT service delivery with increased value and speed to the business. SIAM achieved the following results with a European banking customer: Create transformation roadmap – Facilitated the transformation to more mobile, digital technologies while managing a mix of hybrid cloud and traditional IT services and infrastructure Best of breed approach – Bank can now mix and match SaaS and other cloud-based applications based on their customer’s needs, with a best-of-breed approach to applications Drive service improvement – Managing end-to-end processes across their service providers and tracking overall performance and regulatory compliance. Automated and predictable – Offers a single-entry point for requesting a mix of IT services, ensuring these services are compliant and cost-effective, reducing manual IT tasks, increasing overall visibility, and streamlining approval and change management processes, resulting in automated and predictable provisioning. Expertise—Our experienced SIAM teams serve as the single point of escalation for the client's delivery issues, providing performance improvement and visibility across service providers, while managing and approving operational changes (adding or modifying infrastructure components or software across service providers). Transformation with minimal risk—Advisory and Transformation helps identify how to embark on the SIAM journey, while ensuring the maximum benefits with minimal risks. Scalability—We offer a range of options to meet the client's IT and financial objectives. We don't provide a “one-size-fits-all” approach because SIAM isn't simply categorized. DXC has helped our clients to gain the benefits of SIAM regardless of whether they wanted to build the capability on their own, co-source, or fully outsource to DXC. Adaptability across industries and geographies—Our SIAM service provides global reach and scale, suiting the client's demands across businesses, industries, regions and geographies—with in-country or in-region presence for regulatory drivers and compliance. Regulatory compliance—Our solutions are aligned to and even drive industry standards like ITIL and IT4IT, providing necessary safety according to client requirements. DXC has engaged with more than 30 of our top 200 enterprise accounts, managing an average of six primary outsourcing partners and 20+ secondary service providers. DXC delivers services to over 1,000 clients worldwide, including some of the world's largest enterprises and governments. DXC's IT Service Management (ITSM) expertise includes 4.4 million changes, incidents, and requests per month. DXC employs 12,000+ ITIL-certified professionals. Clients are spending time addressing operational topics, coordinating service providers, and fire-fighting rather than planning for business strategy and outcomes and continuous improvement programs. This challenge leads to the perception that IT is the problem. In reality, the service provider landscape in the hybrid IT environment is out-pacing the client's ability to provide services in an integrated way, resulting in low service quality, limited flexibility and ability, and increasing time-to-market. Implementation and Transition/Transformation time: Average T&T timeframe is typically phased. The initial implementation is within 5-6 months. The service provider onboarding follows this phase, and is evaluated on an individual basis. SIAM is typically a transformation project, with longer transition cycles. Deal value/size/length: Average deal $5M-$50M TCV, contract length 36 months (est. 4% to 8% of annual outsourcing budget) Regional factors: Global, all industry groups Pricing Model Options: the client can select which services are required based on modules and volumes      CLIENT   REGION   INDUSTRY   CLOSED/WON        apoBank   N.C.

          "page_body": "DXC Virtual Desktop and Applications Services (VDA) provide virtualized Windows/Linux applications and desktops from the security of a datacenter or from the cloud. Virtualized applications and desktops are accessible from a company's secure network or from the public Internet, allowing users flexible and secure work location and device options, including bring your own device (BYOD). The service bundles end-user assessment, solution design, implementation, and ongoing management for a monthly per-user price. VDA can decrease end-user support and management costs, while significantly increasing data security by moving it off endpoint devices into the datacenter. Support for iOS, Android, Macintosh and Windows endpoint devices provides users with device choices beyond the company PC and better datacenter-based application performance. The introduction of Windows 10, BYOD, and cloud services together pressure to reduce costs are driving enterprises to deliver workplace services differently. DXC Virtual Desktop and Applications Services help clients manage workplace complexities while  enabling them to meet business objectives, lower cost, increase the speed of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and improve data security. Lower cost—DXC helped a manufacturing company implement a digital workplace in which VDA was a major contributor to saving 50% of their previous budget annually.  Increase speed—VDA helped a healthcare corporation split from their parent company ahead of schedule effectively reducing their tax rate from 26% to 23%.  Improve data security—A European Bank became the financial industry's first \"PC-free\" bank in their effort to improve data security and improve secure access to key corporate applications. .  Flexible—DXC provides flexible service configurations, infrastructure, and delivery locations. We can run virtualization solutions in traditional data center at your location or ours, a Private cloud or Microsoft Azure. In addition, we provide  delivery resources from five VDA Centers of Excellence around the world.  Experienced—DXC has been designing, implementing, and operating VDA and the servers they run on for over 18 years. Our experience is both deep (complex environments) and wide (global, multi-site implementations). With over 1 Million supported  users and 110,000 supported virtual applications, we are a Gartner-recognized global leader.  Increased speed to value—Repeatable transformation processes and a service deployment methodology that use empirical data to size the virtualization infrastructure and optimize deployment strategies eliminates the guesswork that can destabilize  the rollout period.  Partnerships—Longstanding, close partnerships with industry leaders—like Microsoft, Citrix, and VMware—enable us to develop, build, configure, and tune server platforms to perform VDA. Our strong partnerships provide an excellent  platform for delivering high-quality VDA.  Comprehensive—DXC is committed to an integrated view of your workplace, with VDA being an important element in a comprehensive workplace strategy.

Whether the client is transforming to next-generation infrastructure or adding new functionality to the IT estate, DXC can help enterprises make a seamless digital transformation through these Managed SDN Services: WAN services WANs are the links that tie enterprises to their remote locations, clients, cloud service providers and data centers. WANs must provide secure services driven by SLAs while providing more agile, cost-effective connectivity. DXC offers two software-defined WAN solutions targeted at different connectivity issues: cloud connectivity and WAN costs AT&T NetBond for Cloud is an option added to an AT&T MPLS circuit that provides connectivity to more than 20 different cloud service providers, including AWS and Azure. With NetBond, the cloud service providers appear as nodes on your existing MPLS network. NetBond greatly simplifies the process of connecting while providing the security and reliability of MPLS. NetBond is available globally and provides simple, secure, cost-effective support for hybrid cloud environments. DXC Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN), powered by AT&T, applies software-defined networking concepts to WAN connections. Our SD-WAN solution automatically determines the most effective way to route traffic to and from campus and data center sites. DXC SD-WAN service lowers operational and capital costs, ensuring lower total cost of ownership, greater business agility and responsiveness to keep pace with IT innovations. The Edge The boundary between the enterprise WAN and campus LANs must ensure high reliability and security. DXC and AT&T are working together to provide next-generation technology to the edge, including: AT&T FlexWare, which combines SDN and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies to simplify network infrastructure while potentially lowering capital investments. By deploying software-based virtual appliances instead of hardware, organizations can reduce time, labor and costs associated with buying, installing, configuring and maintaining separate physical and proprietary network equipment. Data center DXC Software-Defined Data Center LAN (SD-DC LAN) service enables organizations to expand their networks without being locked into vendors. Our SD-DC LAN, based on VMware’s NSX and Arista switching technology, helps improve agility and security in today’s hybrid computing environments. DXC and AT&T have deep experience and an integrated delivery model.

          "page_body": "DXC Digital Workplace Consulting creates value for clients by helping stakeholders formulate goals, develop strategy and plan a roadmap for meaningful business change enabled by flexible, emerging technology solutions. Our experts meet clients’ business and IT needs through transforming and implementing some of the world’s largest and most complex businesses including people, processes and technology. Our services include: Digital WorkPLACE—Enabling successful business transformation, fully exploiting digital workplace technologies and providing users with the tools and technology they need to drive their engagement and optimize productivity. Digital WorkSPACE—Placing the user at the center of the digital workplace – focusing on user experience design and re-defining the modern workspace. Digital WorkFORCE—Focusing on the most important factor of any digital transformation – people. Embedding new ways of working and culture change, providing organizations with digital skills through effective management of change and business/IT operating model transformation. Working across DXC and strategic partners, we provide consulting services that make a strong impact on our clients’ workplace, adding real value to their business in the forms of increased productivity, reduced costs and increased employee engagement. Increase productivity—DXC worked with a major rail client to transform paper-based processes to a mobile-enabled digital workforce. The client realized a 33% reduction in effort to process orders and a 40% reduction in administration requirements. Reduced cost—DXC worked with a large financial institution to consolidate real estate and redefine the physical workspace of the future. Significant cost savings were reinvested into the workspace program to make it effectively self-funding. Increased employee engagement—Working with a global telecommunications and technology company, DXC established a complete communications and engagement plan including training needs analysis and ways of working preparedness. The increase in engagement across business units resulted in much-improved support for transformation activities, increased overall adoption and improved working efficiency. Knowledge—As the world’s leading IT services company, we deliver traditional IT operations and strategies for a modern enterprise. Our technical and industry knowledge allows us to create business solutions that integrate legacy environments into the modern enterprise. Experience—DXC brings the most comprehensive view of industry-leading IP, frameworks, and methodologies evolved from over 50 years of experience in workplace management to address client business objectives. The unmatched breadth of our product and service offerings, experienced advisors, specialized subject matter experts, and global delivery capabilities enable a superior consulting service. Partnerships—Industry-leading technology partnerships with major vendors and a strategic partnership with PwC enables DXC to bring the best strategy, business and technology consulting to solve the business problems of C-Level executives across any industry. Accountability—DXC brings comprehensive accountability for every aspect of the workplace journey: consulting, transformation,and management services. Count on a single partner to cover infrastructure, applications and operations. Technology-agnostic, end-to-end services—DXC bases our consulting services on open standards and multiple vendors. We recommend the right solution to meet your workplace business goals. We provide end-to-end services from strategy to operations that can be delivered through our technology offering families that provide run and maintain services. Pure consultancies or pure technology services players do not offer end-to-end services. 3,000+ consultants in DXC consulting globally, with access to 16,000+ across DXC and 200,000+ in PwC End-to-end capabilities for workplace services supported by investments in IP (e.g. MyWorkStyle) Serve ~7 million users through service desk and mobile/PC support services Balanced, scaled and comprehensive workplace services portfolio, strong client relationships and references Digital is driving businesses to be “faster, better, cheaper.” Clients need the tools that support organization/business changes and reflect employee behaviors for increased agility and flexibility (faster). Employees need a better user experience to find the information they need more quickly. Clients need to serve their customers more efficiently to improve customer relationships (better). Clients seek to introduce more effective ways to meet virtually, cutting travel and telecommunication costs and eliminating wasted time traveling (cheaper). No matter the driver, clients do not always have the resources and skills to implement successful digital transformation. They need to engage third parties to consult and implement the desired change. Open Doors to the C-Suite—Consulting engagements change the conversation to more of a top-down, C-suite conversation about the clients’ digital innovation agenda in areas of the business where bigger budgets reside. High-margin, Revenue-intensive (ABR)—Consulting deals are high margin (> 40%), revenue-intensive deals that generate strong in-year revenue. Significant Pull-through Opportunities—Small Workplace consulting engagements around Office 365 can lead to significant pull-through of large-scale workplace transformation and managed services opportunities. T&M and Fixed Price Contracts—Consulting engagements are people-driven based on time and materials, or fixed-price when a fixed scope is well-defined.

DXC Managed Connectivity Services help our clients see the cost and service delivery benefits of moving to next-generation network solutions, while maximizing the life span of legacy infrastructure. We ensure clients maintain the highest security standards and fulfill growing regulatory requirements through three connectivity offers: Global Connectivity provides a standard, secure, SLA-driven, competitively priced solution to clients in all regions. Leveraged Connectivity enables clients to take advantage of DXC's market presence to buy bandwidth when needed, while maintaining the security and quality they expect. Third-Party Connectivity allows clients to use the transport providers they prefer while keeping DXC responsible for overall network solution integration. Global Connectivity Through our strategic partnership with AT&T, DXC provides a globally consistent set of connectivity solutions: DXC VPN, Powered by AT&T is an MPLS Service that creates a highly secure network connecting multiple locations and users.

          "page_body": "DXC Storage as a Service is a fully managed service for block, file and object storage demands. DXC manages the purchase and provision of storage software and hardware, and hosts it in a client or DXC data center, in a shared or dedicated environment. Clients consume next-generation storage on a gigabyte basis, and can allocate data in different performance/availability tiers depending on its usage or value. We can support 10TB infrastructures and more. Fine-tune storage requirements through six classes of service for block data like databases, three classes of service for file data, and an ultra-high performance all-Flash option. Unlike procuring storage infrastructure through a traditional capital expense model where clients buy storage capacity in large segments, DXC Storage as a Service allows clients to move from a CapEx to OpEx procurement model. Clients pay only for the storage they use after data reduction freeing up capital to support other business needs. Clients also gain complete visibility into storage performance and costs, increase business agility with our capacity buffer, and can reduce overall storage costs by 30 percent. Increase business agility—A global technology company saved 30% on its storage costs using an as-a-service model. They can now meet future storage needs in a convenient and highly-agile manner through the utility construct and provided buffer capacity. Reduce costs—A global security and defense products company reduced IT spend on unstructured storage by 52% over a 5-year period with storage as a service. Right-size performance—The naval equipment division of a global defense products company implemented storage as a service to save 50% on storage costs by moving infrequently accessed data to cost-effective object storage service. DXC’s storage service uses policies to move data to low-cost object storage based on the client’s access patterns of the data. Cost optimization—Unlike competitors who model increases in storage costs over time, DXC helps clients optimize and even reduce storage costs. Our approach informs the client about capacity and performance, and we make it easy for them to see where they might be paying for performance they are not using. Expertise—DXC manages 750 petabytes of storage for clients, and has over 50 years’ experience in managing compute and data environments for commercial and public sector organizations across the globe. DXC leverages this expertise and our partner network to build the right solution for any workload. Flexibility—Quickly scale storage needs up/down based on business demand through a simple service catalog and a 10% capacity buffer. Vertical industry experience—DXC is one of few providers that can fully understand a client’s industry and the implications to their digital transformation, storage environment and cloud, hybrid and compute models. Security—DXC provides end-to-end security expertise to protect client data, offering three levels of data protection from replication to full disaster recovery. We can deliver Storage as a Service in the most highly secure environments. DXC manages over 750 petabytes of storage and 250 petabytes of backup for clients Best-of-breed hardware and software partners create a robust, enterprise-class service ISO 27001 certified data centers, with ISO 9001 and ITIL-compliant processes Global support for the utility model available in 29 countries with on- shore and offshore delivery models Traditional data storage environments are capital intensive, lack automated, comprehensive reporting and visibility, and cannot scale as quickly as a client’s business changes. Capital purchasing cycles take too long to respond to peaks in demand. When storage demand decreases, clients pay for excess capacity that sits unused. Cloud and hybrid computing models need equally adaptive storage and recovery models, which is why many companies are adopting an as-a-service model for their storage environments. Further, many industries are experiencing merger and acquisition activities, and need to consolidate overlapping and aging infrastructures. Increases in government and industry regulation place an even greater responsibility on organizations to ensure compliance to these directives. Deal size—3-year term, deal TCV ranges $1M – $3M with a low base starting point that grows higher in out years. Cross-sell opportunities include Backup as a Service, Continuity Services, and any of our Cloud offerings Pricing—Per written consumed gigabyte for the base service and the optional services of replication, snapshots, and disk encryption Transition/Transformation—It typically takes seven weeks from contract signing to stand up the service Target clients—Clients in any region/industry seeking to scale storage without capital investment    CLIENT  REGION  INDUSTRY  CLOSED/WON     United Technologies Corp  Americas  Manufacturing  Oct 2017    DSB  N.C.
