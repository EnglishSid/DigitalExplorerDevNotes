DXC Material Data Compliance offering consists of two main solutions—one for the automobile industry, the International Material Data System (IMDS) that enables automotive OEMs to collect and track the chemical ingredients of parts and assemblies across their entire manufacturing supply chain for compliance with the End-of life vehicles (ELV) Directive and other legal requirements. The second solution concerns manufacturing in general: the Compliance Data Exchange (CDX) system, which generalizes this approach to a wider scope of industries and regulations The IMDS solution provides a venue for information exchange between car manufacturers and their suppliers (and their suppliers' suppliers) about the materials used in all the components of a vehicle. Automotive OEMs need to be compliant and save considerable amounts of money for non-compliance with existing regulations Type approval for new car models depends on the material compliance data available through IMDS Reducing the risk of non-compliance is essential for staying on the market Product recall costs are minimized by data collection and documentation in IMDS With the same background of legal requirements for other manufacturing industries, CDX helps companies systematically create, receive, and evaluate material information from their supply chain to comply with hazardous materials regulations. Both data collection and analysis are offered in a standardized way, providing an efficient and low-cost solution to the OEMs in manufacturing while keeping intellectual property secure. Electronics manufacturers needs to be compliant concerning RoHS/REACH/Conflict Minerals in order to stay on the market Comprehensive IT solutions—Both DXC Material Data Compliance solutions are comprehensive IT solutions that effectively meet global regulatory requirements.2.3. Basic functionalities are free—DXC Material Data Compliance service is with basic functions free for the suppliers; premium functionality is offered at attractive price levels. The price for special modules like Conflict Minerals Reporting is based on fixed-price per calendar year. Global availability—Both offering solutions provide global availability and around-the-clock operations. Software-as-a-Service—IMDS and CDX solutions are offered as Software-as-a-Service and do not require hardware or software investment. Interface solutions—Additionally, interface solutions to other systems are offered (e.g., clients' in-house systems) as well as to existing standard solutions. Import and export of Excel-based EICC-GeSI-compliant reports are supported, which eliminates rewrites. IMDS users include 40 well-known automotive OEMs representing more than 60 different brands of vehicles All tiers of automotive suppliers use IMDS—anyone in the supply chain with internet access In 17+ years of operation, 335,000+ users in 130,000+companies have registered in IMDS generating more than 50 million data sheets (numbers from July 2018) Experience with IMDS led to the development of the manufacturing solution CDX Meeting international regulatory requirements prevents organizations from penalties Requesting and evaluating information on materials from the supply chain is essential to an organization's efficiency and quality. It's also vital to managing and reporting hazardous substances, which are required to meet legal requirements that vary by region and country. Cost efficiency influences procurement and production processes, and recycling and scrapping. This requires additional data and transparency about supplied products. An increase in turnover involves a new approach to sustainability. Minimizing disposal risks with adequate documentation and avoiding problematic product contents help ensure a positive corporate image and stable brand value. IMDS is paid for by the automobile industry OEMs and is free for the suppliers. A standard CDX deal uses a pay-per-data volume model with standardized terms of service—no multimillion-dollar integration project. Data volume purchases can range from $2500 to$50,000+ USD; first fiscal year revenue potential is medium. An OEM could increase revenues by $130,000 USD through use of CDX.

Archiving Services enable a range of benefits for clients including: reducing data storage and compliance costs, retiring legacy applications, minimizing personal data, increasing the value of inactive or unused business data, ensuring compliance with changing regulations, and protecting valuable information assets. DXC‘s archiving methodology covers a wide range of data types—such as email and office files and data from business applications—and allows businesses across all industries to transform static information into a dynamic data storehouse. Organizations feel squeezed between rising data storage spending, compliance costs, and increasing government regulations. It is a complex task to manage the retention and disposition of a rapidly growing volume and variety of information, to mitigate risk, maintain service levels for key applications, and to decommission outdated ones. Archiving Services enable customers to take control of their information, manage it as a business asset, and increase their competitive advantage. Retire legacy applications—Archiving Services have enabled a client to shutdown a datacenter and save $23M with a return on invest of 1,300% by retiring 500 applications. Reduce storage costs—Clients take control of business files and messages, freeing up large quantities of expensive storage, and enabling them to actively manage the disposition of outdated content, resulting not only in storage savings of roughly 200TB for a $15B manufacturing company, but also reduced litigation expenses. Act on data privacy regulation—Based on DXC Archiving Services, we have enabled customers to achieve compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar global legislation by cross system treatment of data including provable disposition of non-compliant personal data, avoiding potential multi-billion dollar fines for GDPR non-compliance. DXC expertise—Skilled DXC archiving experts help clients to achieve archiving results—to analyze data sources, set up and execute archiving in the best way for the data, manage large numbers of concurrent archiving projects effectively, and use the archive skillfully to derive additional business value from stored data. One archive for all data—Whether the material includes messages, office files, data from SAP or non-SAP systems, or other sources, a comprehensive archive for all data simplifies operations, avoids compliance risks, and augments the value of archived information by the ability to correlate it. Flexibility—We offer many options to adapt an archive to your service needs. These include flexible options to access archived data for almost any purpose, a large number of connectors to archive from almost any application or repository, and flexible deployment options: on premise, traditional managed services, or as-a-service delivery. Market leading solutions—DXC has strong partnerships and extensive implementation experience with Micro Focus and Data Migration Services, whose archiving and related solutions are highly rated by analysts. Global delivery capability—With 95 Data Centers, 9,200 Analytics Consultants, >20 Global and Regional Delivery Centers and 20+ years of experience, DXC truly has a global reach.

          "page_body": "DXC Data Classification Services provides expert services to assist clients better understand existing system data and to protect and exploit their data on an ongoing basis. Data Classification Services enables a range of benefits, including reducing the risk of data loss or noncompliance to data legislation, optimizing data storage across information systems and enabling business users to maximize the benefits from data by improving accessibility and business processes. The Data Classification offering uses a comprehensive but flexible approach to create a program of activities that encompass all types of digital data across an organization, no matter what system the data are held on. This offering enables organizations to understand and control the data in their systems, to exploit the information and to control costs and risks associated with it. Data classification is the first step to take control before other governance activities are undertaken. As part of DXC’s Information Governance method, this offering provides a holistic approach to classification without tool vendor bias. Lower cost—As much as 30% of an organization’s unstructured information is redundant, outdated or trivial (ROT); up to 40% of data has indeterminate value. Data classification results enabled an organization to defensibly dispose of hundreds of terabytes of ROT from expensive local branch and central file shares. More value—Automatically identifying business records and assigning them to appropriate records categories helped an organization achieve better findability, faster collaboration, and enabled records to be treated according to business value. Lower risk—EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) non-compliance fines may be greater than €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue from the prior year. Several Data Classification Services clients are finding and mapping personal data under GDPR as a necessary first step to identify leakage and implement GDPR compliant business processes, avoiding huge potential fines. Proven experience—DXC information governance specialists have delivered classification projects for many real customers. Flexible delivery capability—DXC can resource projects with experienced people both onsite and from multiple delivery centers to best shape a project for individual customer’s needs. Vendor agnostic—DXC does not produce or sell our own software or tools and therefore can advise customers without bias. DXC does have partner relationships with leading vendors and is able to pass on preferential software discounts to clients. Comprehensive method—DXC’s service is based on a comprehensive approach to classification, developed to provide customers measurable results from their classification project. Affordable start to information governance—DXC’s holistic approach to information governance means that classification projects can be a quick start for a wider program, informing further activities if required.  900+ analytics clients worldwide  3,500+ information management and business intelligence professionals around the world  More than 100 dedicated data scientists in global delivery centers  18+ years of analytics experience with Fortune 500 clients worldwide Organizations are squeezed by rising data cost, tightening compliance demands and heightened public awareness of data breaches. Many companies have difficulty envisioning their information as a business asset as they struggle to manually categorize their data. The pressures underlying data management lead to hoarding behavior, which exacerbates the concerns involving data. Hoarding entails a compliance risk and exposes companies to increased litigation cost and data leakage risk.

          "full_body": "Data Classification Services, Data Management, Data, Information Governance, data loss, data legislation, data storage Optimize data management by aligning it with the business value of information throughout the information lifecycle. DXC Data Classification Services provides expert services to assist clients better understand existing system data and to protect and exploit their data on an ongoing basis. Data Classification Services enables a range of benefits, including reducing the risk of data loss or noncompliance to data legislation, optimizing data storage across information systems and enabling business users to maximize the benefits from data by improving accessibility and business processes. The Data Classification offering uses a comprehensive but flexible approach to create a program of activities that encompass all types of digital data across an organization, no matter what system the data are held on. This offering enables organizations to understand and control the data in their systems, to exploit the information and to control costs and risks associated with it. Data classification is the first step to take control before other governance activities are undertaken. As part of DXC’s Information Governance method, this offering provides a holistic approach to classification without tool vendor bias. Lower cost—As much as 30% of an organization’s unstructured information is redundant, outdated or trivial (ROT); up to 40% of data has indeterminate value. Data classification results enabled an organization to defensibly dispose of hundreds of terabytes of ROT from expensive local branch and central file shares. More value—Automatically identifying business records and assigning them to appropriate records categories helped an organization achieve better findability, faster collaboration, and enabled records to be treated according to business value. Lower risk—EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) non-compliance fines may be greater than €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue from the prior year. Several Data Classification Services clients are finding and mapping personal data under GDPR as a necessary first step to identify leakage and implement GDPR compliant business processes, avoiding huge potential fines. Proven experience—DXC information governance specialists have delivered classification projects for many real customers. Flexible delivery capability—DXC can resource projects with experienced people both onsite and from multiple delivery centers to best shape a project for individual customer’s needs. Vendor agnostic—DXC does not produce or sell our own software or tools and therefore can advise customers without bias. DXC does have partner relationships with leading vendors and is able to pass on preferential software discounts to clients. Comprehensive method—DXC’s service is based on a comprehensive approach to classification, developed to provide customers measurable results from their classification project. Affordable start to information governance—DXC’s holistic approach to information governance means that classification projects can be a quick start for a wider program, informing further activities if required.  900+ analytics clients worldwide  3,500+ information management and business intelligence professionals around the world  More than 100 dedicated data scientists in global delivery centers  18+ years of analytics experience with Fortune 500 clients worldwide Organizations are squeezed by rising data cost, tightening compliance demands and heightened public awareness of data breaches. Many companies have difficulty envisioning their information as a business asset as they struggle to manually categorize their data. The pressures underlying data management lead to hoarding behavior, which exacerbates the concerns involving data. Hoarding entails a compliance risk and exposes companies to increased litigation cost and data leakage risk. The increasing volumes also affect organizations’ ability to move to cloud storage solutions. As a result, organizations lack control over their data, are unable to derive valuable insights from it and are unable to mitigate compliance risk.

Our services enable clients to improve and streamline information processes so that clients can remain compliant with organizational and regulatory mandates. C&RMS can also improve business efficiency and productivity, information security, and operational cost savings significantly by managing both business documents and records proactively throughout their lifecycle from the point of creation. DXC offers flexible delivery options (on premises, as a service, or hybrid) and commercial models to minimize investment risk. This offering enables clients to transform information into vital resources—into dollars saved or costs avoided. These benefits result when clients capture, manage, secure, and discover business assets to meet governance and regulatory compliance. Better productivity and efficiency—Individuals can spend an average of four weeks a year searching for misfiled, mislabeled, untracked, or “lost” information, spending about 26% of their efforts looking, while finding what is needed only 56% of the time.1 Through workflow and policy-enabled processes, C&RMS has cut approval times by 60% (from days to hours to minutes), depending on the use case. Lower risk—Penalties for non-compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act could be as high as $725,000 for each act meeting specific criteria. C&RMS enables better control over information to guard against data leaks, ensure greater regulatory compliance, and prevent data spoliation and any resulting sanctions, fines, and lawsuits. Lower cost—As much as 30% of an organization’s unstructured information is redundant, outdated, or trivial (ROT); up to 50% of data has an indeterminate value.2 A better approach is to identify and maintain the truly important data and to dispose of the rest, yielding a smaller storage footprint, a lower IT and administration spend, more effective legal holds, and more cost-effective e-Discovery.

Learn more from the video. Regardless of size, industry or analytics maturity, organizations struggle to get all the necessary data in one place, consistently organized and classified for the spend and procurement analytics they need. DXC Spend Analytics has a flexible approach, offering end-to-end spend data transformation and visualizations as-a-service or leveraging our 15 years of experience with over 1,000 public and private sector clients to quickly deliver custom projects or enhance a client's existing solution. For clients anywhere on the procurement maturity spectrum, DXC can deliver the procurement management information needed to gain better control of spending, save money, reduce risk and improve efficiency in procurement processes and practices. DXC Spend Analytics provides clients accurate data and deep insights to get more value out of every dollar their organization spends on goods and services, make procurement processes more efficient, engage with their business effectively, reduce supply chain risk, deliver procurement sustainability and diversity goals, and increase procurement compliance. Best possible data—From a Fortune 500 company operating as 12 separate business units with 12 enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in four countries to a small public sector organization with a very old AP system, DXC leverages a 500M item and 16M supplier reference database, data scientists, external data sources, machine learning, traditional BI techniques, and a private crowd of research analysts to routinely reach over 97% classification rates, match in data from third party sources and deliver clients the most accurate and reliable procurement data possible. Quick time to value— DXC assembles prebuilt, scalable data transformation and visualization components, where possible, to deliver clients transformed procurement data and visualizations in as few as 2 weeks. One manufacturing client got its first insights in 10 business days, enabling it to identify millions in indirect cost savings 6 months earlier than they anticipated. Minimal client resources required—DXC leverages the experience of working with over 1,000 clients to minimize the time and resources our clients put in to get a spend and procurement analytics deliverable focused on their strategic objectives and priorities. One client was spending two weeks extracting and manipulating their data prior to providing it to their previous spend analytics supplier; DXC reduced that to 16 hours for the first extraction and 2 hours for each subsequent update. Deep domain expertise—DXC puts to work the expertise gained from over 15 years as trusted advisors to senior procurement and finance professionals in the delivery of procurement analytics solutions to over 1,000 organizations. Flexibility to choose components—DXC’s analytics expertise, technology partnerships and experience in custom and industry standard categorization taxonomies create flexibility to choose the best components to meet the client's requirements and deliver insights well beyond those from rigidly fixed spend analysis tools or those linked directly to a transactional system. Focus on outcomes—Component flexibility allows DXC to focus on clients’ objectives and priorities, delivering analytics that provide answers to the key business questions rather than forcing the client’s needs to fit a preconfigured solution. Focus on data—DXC utilizes classification taxonomies that are appropriate for the type of data, industry sector and analytical output required, combining traditional BI and AI tools and methods, supported by human validation throughout the process to deliver analytics relevant to our clients’ needs and available data. Results for all maturity levels—DXC has delivered procurement analytics for clients of all sizes and at both ends of the procurement analytics maturity spectrum. Whether the client is just starting out or has already invested in in-house analytics skills and technologies, DXC can help them deliver the next level of insights. Fifteen years’ experience, 1,000+ clients, 4,000+ datasets and $750B+ of spend transformed Delivered spend visibility to organizations with 1, 2, 5, 12, 15, 24 and 100+ business units and unique data sources Most customers stay more than 5 years Companies struggle to get accurate, actionable, holistic visibility of procurement and spend data. Companies with multiple procurement transaction systems, such as those companies built by acquisition, struggle even more. Spend data often includes duplicate  suppliers, inconsistent/incorrect classifications, and is missing third party data points about suppliers critical to a modern procurement function. Reporting is frequently in spreadsheets, duplicated between business units and inaccessible to non-analyst  staff within the client's organization.

Focus on data—DXC utilizes classification taxonomies that are appropriate for the type of data, industry sector and analytical output required, combining traditional BI and AI tools and methods, supported by human validation throughout the process to deliver analytics relevant to our clients’ needs and available data. Results for all maturity levels—DXC has delivered procurement analytics for clients of all sizes and at both ends of the procurement analytics maturity spectrum. Whether the client is just starting out or has already invested in in-house analytics skills and technologies, DXC can help them deliver the next level of insights. Fifteen years’ experience, 1,000+ clients, 4,000+ datasets and $750B+ of spend transformed Delivered spend visibility to organizations with 1, 2, 5, 12, 15, 24 and 100+ business units and unique data sources Most customers stay more than 5 years Companies struggle to get accurate, actionable, holistic visibility of procurement and spend data. Companies with multiple procurement transaction systems, such as those companies built by acquisition, struggle even more. Spend data often includes duplicate  suppliers, inconsistent/incorrect classifications, and is missing third party data points about suppliers critical to a modern procurement function. Reporting is frequently in spreadsheets, duplicated between business units and inaccessible to non-analyst  staff within the client's organization.

DXC Customer Analytics help clients to integrate and establish a real-time view of the customer and provide predictive insights for wide distribution across all touch points, for personalized recommendations and relevant customer interactions to increase  the wallet share of their customers. Enterprises now have to evolve their customer strategies to attract and keep the new generation of customers as much as other generations.

It allows clients to rapidly harness the power of analytics and AI with simplicity, choice and flexibility. Clients can avoid major investments that become obsolete before they’re deployed. And, our approach positions clients to take ongoing advantage of rapid advances in AI, automation and core analytics technologies. This offering is available as a production-ready package with industrial SLAs and flexible configuration options. Delegating the IT complexity to DXC allows the client to focus on delivering value to the business. Many enterprises are ready to adopt new analytics and AI solutions but remain hesitant to accept technology and vendor lock-in. Further, they are concerned with the need for skills around rapidly evolving new tools and the cloud. Also, they don't want to make long-term financial commitments that would add to their on-premise footprint. DXC addresses these needs with the DXC Analytics and Al Platform and handles the IT complexity of deploying the platform so clients can focus on delivering value to the business. Fast track to analytics — Clients onboard to the enterprise-grade analytics platform in days and can deliver business results in weeks, rather than months. Enable AI applications — Clients get access to advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) toolsets and supporting DevOps processes, well integrated with the core platform. The right, agile solution options — DXC has integrated several analytic utilities into the platform which are commonly used for developing and sharing analytic solutions, thereby reducing our clients need to evaluate, install, and configure these tools. An end-to-end service — Clients have multiple deployment options in the cloud and on-premise to address diverse compute and storage needs. We provisioned platforms and on-boarded project teams for both virtualized starter-tier and physical standard-tier environments in two-to-four weeks as promised. Accelerate path to business value — With DXC Analytics and AI Platform, organizations can focus on their business and accelerate their analytics adoption while DXC focuses on deployment of new analytics technologies. Our experience, packaged in design patterns and solution accelerators enable rapid deployment and execution of targeted business use cases. Market innovator — An industry leader, DXC provides a complete analytics and big data platform solution incorporating latest advances in AI tooling and DevOps. With over 50 years of experience in wrangling and integrating data to power use cases, DXC's analytics, data management, industry and domain skills are unmatched. Superior data science and managed services — Our managed service leverages our deep pool of technical, business and industry experts who specialize in data science, in addition to traditional run services. DXC applied field-tested methodologies, processes and tools spanning hybrid environments. Best-in-class solutions leveraging a robust partner network — As an independent IT solutions provider, we've assembled the most technically advanced platform by combining our capabilities with the products and services of industry-leading, world-class technology partners. Agility and scalability — Analytics and AI applications are continuously evolving. DXC's solution is flexible, functionally extensible and easily scalable with multiple deployment options across public clouds, on-premise and hybrid. Rapid deployment (in days) of multiple on demand environments for customer projects needing to produce results in weeks Successful deployment and on-going management of several complex, secured Hadoop-based corporate data lake platforms (100's TB up) Proven ability to design and implement high availability Hadoop platforms, with demanding disaster recovery requirements Enterprise grade solutions combining high performance ingestion, container-based data science and AI workbench, in hybrid, on-premise and cloud models While clients invest significantly in Hadoop or cloud-native analytic services initiatives, most are not yet realizing value. Root causes include the complexity and risks associated with rapidly evolving analytics platform technologies, a shortage of skills, significant up-front investments required, and lack of methodologies to execute such project initiatives. Leveraging the cloud is one way to mitigate these issues. However, a bewildering array of Hadoop on cloud and competing native services options for analytics and Al is daunting. Clients must select the right reference architectures and supplement cloud provider's offering with in-house resources, adding to cost, complexity, and risk. Deals are typically scoped for discovery or production environments and are categorized by volume of raw data, sizes of processing clusters (e.g., Hadoop), and term duration. Add-ons include analytics and technical consulting and data integration. General pricing guidelines: Starter—Between 1-10TB of data for approximately $60K to $200K per year plus a one-time onboarding fee and any add-ons Standard—Between 10-50TB of data for approximately $200K to $1M per year plus a one-time onboarding fee and any add-ons X-Large—Typically on-premises for 50TB of data or larger, $1M or greater for infrastructure and managed services per year plus on-premise setup charges and any add-ons  Client Region Industry Closed/Won  Australian Tax Office ANZ Public Sector 2015, 2017, 2018 State of Ohio Americas Public Sector 2016 State of Tennessee Americas Public Sector 2016, 2019 Freedom Mobile/Shaw Americas Communications, Media & Entertainment 2016, 2017 AHOLD USA, Inc.
