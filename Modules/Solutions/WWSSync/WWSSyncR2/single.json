          "page_body": "DXC Virtual Desktop and Applications Services (VDA) provide virtualized Windows/Linux applications and desktops from the security of a datacenter or from the cloud. Virtualized applications and desktops are accessible from a company's secure network or from the public Internet, allowing users flexible and secure work location and device options, including bring your own device (BYOD). The service bundles end-user assessment, solution design, implementation, and ongoing management for a monthly per-user price. VDA can decrease end-user support and management costs, while significantly increasing data security by moving it off endpoint devices into the datacenter. Support for iOS, Android, Macintosh and Windows endpoint devices provides users with device choices beyond the company PC and better datacenter-based application performance. The introduction of Windows 10, BYOD, and cloud services together pressure to reduce costs are driving enterprises to deliver workplace services differently. DXC Virtual Desktop and Applications Services help clients manage workplace complexities while  enabling them to meet business objectives, lower cost, increase the speed of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and improve data security. Lower cost—DXC helped a manufacturing company implement a digital workplace in which VDA was a major contributor to saving 50% of their previous budget annually.  Increase speed—VDA helped a healthcare corporation split from their parent company ahead of schedule effectively reducing their tax rate from 26% to 23%.  Improve data security—A European Bank became the financial industry's first \"PC-free\" bank in their effort to improve data security and improve secure access to key corporate applications. .  Flexible—DXC provides flexible service configurations, infrastructure, and delivery locations. We can run virtualization solutions in traditional data center at your location or ours, a Private cloud or Microsoft Azure. In addition, we provide  delivery resources from five VDA Centers of Excellence around the world.  Experienced—DXC has been designing, implementing, and operating VDA and the servers they run on for over 18 years. Our experience is both deep (complex environments) and wide (global, multi-site implementations). With over 1 Million supported  users and 110,000 supported virtual applications, we are a Gartner-recognized global leader.  Increased speed to value—Repeatable transformation processes and a service deployment methodology that use empirical data to size the virtualization infrastructure and optimize deployment strategies eliminates the guesswork that can destabilize  the rollout period.  Partnerships—Longstanding, close partnerships with industry leaders—like Microsoft, Citrix, and VMware—enable us to develop, build, configure, and tune server platforms to perform VDA. Our strong partnerships provide an excellent  platform for delivering high-quality VDA.  Comprehensive—DXC is committed to an integrated view of your workplace, with VDA being an important element in a comprehensive workplace strategy. Our strong suite of workplace services provides business value beyond cost reduction by providing  the right tools to the right user at the right time from any location.
