Companies aiming to reduce risk, maintain compliance and improve TCO now want to migrate to cloud and modernize and optimize their legacy application portfolios. They are looking at ways to adopt cloud-native solutions to increase speed-to-market as they integrate digital technologies with legacy applications and data. The digital journey has become a critical priority, but it is often slowed down by siloed business processes, the inability of existing environments to integrate and interoperate with new digital technologies, complex and brittle legacy systems, and performance and scalability problems. In addition, other factors inhibit organizations from effectively modernizing applications: lack of skilled resources and expertise in new technologies, limited documentation, and insufficient application know-how and testing capabilities. Transform your applications with DXC DXC Technology helps you rationalize your application portfolio, reduce IT spends, modernize and transform to cloud-native solutions and integrate across business ecosystems to turbocharge your digital transformation. DXC Application Transformation accelerates two elements of the digital journey: • Migration Services reduce TCO while improving the reliability, maintainability and compatibility with next-generation cloud-native systems Benefits • Migrate on-premises applications to public cloud or modernize in place to reduce costs and stay competitive • Modernize and optimize legacy application portfolios, reduce complexity and risk, maintain compliance and improve total cost of ownership (TCO) • Integrate SaaS, cloud, mobile and IoT solutions with on- premises legacy applications and data, enabling new business models and collaboration across ecosystems • Adopt cloud-native practices to increase productivity and accelerate delivery of new capabilities, driving business value and customer experience • Modernization Services rationalize and modernize application portfolios to deliver more business value, innovate rapidly and integrate across business domains, hybrid, software as a service (SaaS), mobile, and internet of things (IoT) solutions to support new business models.

It is not Generally Available (GA) worldwide. Contact the offering manager listed below prior to engaging with your client to ensure proper support and coverage for your opportunity. Overview Offering Description DXC Smart Factory deploys agile delivery approaches to introduce new digital capabilities that at each stage deliver value to manufacturing operations leading to major improvements in manufacturing output, better quality and improved on-time delivery. The principle is to capture and present key operational data and intelligent machine and human tasking that will lead to better implementation of production operations, maintenance, quality and inventory processes whilst proving a new rich intelligence capability to our clients. Value Proposition DXC Technology helps our clients to understand and realize the financial benefits of introducing new smart manufacturing technologies, through the fast-track delivery of a digital manufacturing (industry 4.0) capability using the DXC Smart Factory templated approach. The basis of DXC's solution is to deploy agile delivery approaches to introduce new digital capabilities that at each stage deliver value to manufacturing operations. The principle is to capture and present key operational data and intelligent machine and human tasking that will lead to better implementation of production operations, maintenance, quality and inventory processes whilst providing a new rich intelligence capability to our clients. DXC is working closely with a rich ecosystem of partners to deliver the Smart Factory roadmap from an end-to-end perspective. These include PTC, iBASEt, Siemens and Dassault Systemes for the core smart factory platform. DXC will also partner with hardware and networking partners who are providing a range of wireless, IoT gateways and sensors to accommodate all types of factory machinery, demanding government security requirements, high resilience needs and environmental conditions such as electromagnetic interference. DXC uses its industry subject matter experts to work with our clients' shop floor operators and management team to ensure the business benefits are realized. This is vital in digital transformation where culture, mind-set and multi-dimensional information present new challenges for our clients. Why DXC? Experience well beyond PoCs—Detailed knowledge of use cases and deployment at scale.  Competence to deliver complex projects on a global scale:    DXC is helping a major European A&D company by providing cloud migration, security and analytics services. DXC is modernizing the client's IT architecture and building an agile platform so they can develop and deploy solutions such as next-generation smart factories, optimize assets and use artificial intelligence to help with everyday business challenges.   More A&D companies trust DXC to provide their IT services than any other company   DXC is the #1 IT provider in global Top 10 A&D firms providing comprehensive ‘International Traffic in Arms Regulations' (ITAR) -based services   DXC has ITAR resources in 25 countries    Our Partnerships—Our technology independence, partners, and unique approach for assessing, engaging and governing allows us to quickly combine the best skills and technologies into complete solutions and leverage the R&D investments of our partners. Segment specific partners include Siemens, iBASEt, Dassault and GE for MES and PLM, AT&T for networking integration and PTC for IIoT platform deployments, as well as SAP, Synchrono, IFS and INFOR. Proof Points DXC has delivered outcomes for clients including: Doubling manufacturing output and related revenues in 2.5 years with existing machinery and resources  Increasing on-time delivery from 40% to 98%  Reducing WIP inventory by 15% in 2 months  Reducing stock outs of stock parts by 25%  35% Inventory reduction Reducing cost of poor quality by $20 Million over 5 years Level Setting Business Challenges Buyers: SVP/VP for Engineering and Technology; CIO, CDO, VP, Digital Transformation, VP Engineering. Their challenges includes: Speed up manufacturing throughput and improve programme performance to get orders out quicker and on time  Lower the total cost of manufacturing operations  Get timely visibility into overall design, manufacturing and after market performance to create a continuous improvement cycle to understand how to improve design, product, support and operations to reduce product lifetime cost  Meet regulatory and safety standards  Streamline processes and make the transition from linear, document-centric processes to dynamic, digitally-connected processes  Optimize the supply chain and partners to improve supply forecasting and reduce cost for both the client and supply chain partners  Approach Plan Deal Characteristics Offering approach — A Smart Factory will typically be acquired at a program or subsidiary level rather than at a corporation level.  Implementation — Consulting led. The market is largely at the assessment, PoC/MVP and \"next stage\" project stage. We will see an increase in the introduction of analytics, modernization of manufacturing processes and systems, clients considering and beginning ERP modernization (e.g. SAP S4), IT & OT infrastructure modernization and expansion of HPC to meet increasing demands.  Pricing models — A mix of spend ranges of $250K to $500K per project in FY20 with project pull through in the range of $100K to $5M chunks.

Digitizing the Employee Experience 2DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Digital transformation enabled by cloud technologies Human resources is experiencing unprecedented disruption brought about by the digital economy paradigm shift. Competition for top talent is fierce. This, in turn, is requiring a reinvention of human capital management (HCM) to innovate, adapt, optimize and disrupt their current business models. Human resources service delivery is a cloud solution that integrates with on-prem solutions and within a few years all HCM solutions will move to the cloud. Innovative business models depend on robust, equally innovative employment models. To enable the promise of digital requires rethinking how HR enables the business with a holistic mobile employee engagement view. As enterprises move to implement the digital foundation required in the transformation journey, a focus on attaining a more agile and competitive organization is imperative. Many traditional enterprises struggle to prioritize the cloud HCM solution roadmap. • When to migrate to the cloud? • What solutions need to be implemented sooner rather than later? • Are new mobile consumer experience-grade technologies emerging? Forward-thinking HR leaders are tracking and measuring the capabilities and effectiveness of HCM solutions. The days of validating outdated data, maintaining spreadsheets and communicating with time-consuming methods is transitioning with transparent cloud capabilities. DXC’s HR approach to moving applications to the cloud is centered on best-in-class HCM solutions (Oracle, SAP SuccessFactors, ServiceNow HRSD and Workday) that address enterprise concerns and challenges. DXC has the expertise to manage the transitions and enable self-service, mobile employee capabilities with HR service delivery cloud applications. Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes and agility. Our conversations must focus on business agility, organization and financials.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch DXC realizes that today’s CHRO is faced with balancing ever-changing employee and client expectations. As the urgency for digital transformation accelerates, the CHRO must align and keep a critical forward-thinking focus. Providing the digital tools that are needed to enable growth and success will impact future organizational growth. As HR continues to guide the organization, a constant challenge of their own thinking of their roles as leaders must be studied. Old-school ways of task-burdened emails, telephone tag, spreadsheets, disparate systems and lack of transparency must be replaced with agility and capability. It’s a new way of looking at the workforce of the future and driving organizational change to meet the challenges ahead. Impacting the workplace is the new dominance of a younger generation. This is a game changer for human resources. To recruit, attract, develop and retain a workforce of tech-savvy, mobile-enabled and self-reliant learners, organizations must focus on modernizing the approach with digital capabilities. DXC is here to help guide our clients drive digital transformation as a strategic imperative. DXC helps clients to increase operational efficiency by reimagining HR to simplify, modernize and transform in several key ways that address pain points with solution enablement for the organization: • Improve employee engagement — Providing employees with modern digital methods to quickly interact, obtain knowledge and solve problems increases organization productivity • Automate HR processes — Automation reduces the number of manual processes, spreadsheet tracking, email and phone exchanges, enabling HR to standardize the global needs of the business • Manage compliance and risk — Analytics and reports provide HR with transparency and understanding to guide the future needs of the organization • HCM suite and HRSD integration — Seamless third-party on-prem and cloud integrations enable HR to standardize the global needs of the business 3 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Maintaining spreadsheets. Lack of transparency and analytics. Listen/probe/respond: The ability to automate processes. Who you sell to — what they care about and what to talk about Digital selling tips Digital selling is different — Digital selling is different — It’s about client engagement. Create a dialogue around the client’s business agenda, the current state pain points, business value we can drive and digital transformation beyond just the IT systems. Do your homework — You must understand the client and industry before you speak with the client. Have the DXC POV worked out, know who the change agents are within the client’s company and how their business operates. Keep an eye out for compelling events. Engage the client — Not only the IT buyer, engage the wider HR business. Reach out to the CHRO/VP of HR and HR shared services to build those relationships. Digital is about bringing HR’s business direction into a state of reality. Seek to understand the client’s current maturity level and digital landscape, and figure out DXC’s relevance in that journey. Doing is the new selling — Use a consultative business-driven approach. Listen, probe and respond about the journey. Create the solution clients want in a minimally viable way so they can attain the desired future state. • Change the way HR serves the business • Rethink and simplify HR processes • Improve the overall user experience to engage employees • Keep pace with technology innovations • Make HRIS as agile as the business • Migrate from on-prem solutions to cloud • HCM vendor gaps in solution capability and the need for case and knowledge management CHRO/VP of HR Focus: Organizational agility to drive business results Problems: Ability to replace processes with modern enablement and digital capabilities; employee skills and competencies to meet the challenges ahead; employee consumer-like experience; building the leadership team; war for talent; building a strategic plan and executing; budget to accomplish goals Listen/probe/respond: Workforce and leadership expectations.

Clients will need to consider the inevitable cloud-first approach when aiming to optimize HR impact to the organization. Example levers to simplify and optimize: • Improve employee satisfaction by making it easier for employees with elevated mobile digital support • Develop great leaders and talent, enabling them with technology • Identify processes and workflows that must be automated, which requires a reinvented HR • Build out a strategy that includes intelligent automation • Target communication with a strategic organizational change management (OCM) plan • Transition HR professionals to become strategists and minimize administrative tasks through automation Opportunity progression Commercial considerations • Structure as an annual program with measurable business case objectives. • Client funds core simplify/optimize engagement, pays for individual projects and receives benefit from each project. • Where DXC assumes financial risk, gain share model may be appropriate. • The target annual savings should be in the range of 10% - 20% of a client’s overall IT budget. • For smaller accounts, a programmatic approach may not be justified — need to proceed commercially, project by project. What’s the conversation? We at DXC recognize that the world around HR clients is changing at an unprecedented pace. Human resources is evaluating the needed skills and retooling the organization with new skillsets that include a digital approach to HR. They understand the need to keep their organization future-proof and able to respond in time to any future challenges. How do clients keep pace with the demand from the internal and external clients? For DXC clients, it’s not about getting to the cloud per se; it is about how their organization will drive the digital transformation to meet the challenge. Cloud is the only sustainable deployment choice for HR long term. DXC’s HR service delivery is the best choice in the market for targeting the “war on talent” and executing HR strategic plans. Clients will need to future-proof HR, and DXC is best in class to help our clients make that digital transformation shift. We know HR service delivery best and provide tools, assets and services to enable our clients with new digital processes for holistic organizational HR success. Client problems HCM core on-prem solutions are transitioning to the cloud. As that happens, the ability to drive consumer-like, employee-centered mobile enablement via HR service delivery is a competitive advantage. HRSD targets the war on talent and enablement of organizational success. Here are a few questions that may be asked and value drivers to consider: • Can we implement a secure service delivery model for case and knowledge management in the cloud with our on-prem core HCM platform? • Retaining and engaging new employees has become challenging. How does HRSD enable this process? • HCM recruiting platforms lack the capability to pre-onboard employees and requires many manual administrative steps in the process. How do we leverage technology to drive onboarding efficiency and employee engagement? — Change the way HR serves the business — Rethink and simplify HR processes — Improve the overall user experience to engage employees — Keep pace with technology innovations — Make HCM as agile as the business — Migrate from on-prem solutions to cloud — Address HCM vendor gaps in solution capability and the need for case and knowledge management Customer Conversation: Digitizing the employee experience 1 2   Manage  Transform  AdviseEngage    Solution focus later   Business needs focus  Industry focusConsulting-led sales 5 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience 7 DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch DXC designs, deploys and secures new cloud and platform solutions at scale that can be integrated with a client’s IT estate to produce better business outcomes. As clients undertake cloud adoption and digital transformation, they face challenges in scaling and managing their new solutions while successfully integrating them with their existing IT landscape. DXC helps clients in three ways: • First, we discover and define their IT and regulatory estate, using people, processes and products to deliver a solid referential data layer for GRC and SecOps automation. • Second, we structure digitally their GRC and SecOps landscape by adopting and adapting best practice, pre-built policies, processes, controls, frameworks and runbooks. • Finally, we transform their operational resilience by reducing the scale and velocity of work through an automated, controlled response to threats to stability of any kind, along with a comprehensive MI layer to provide transparency and clarity. We have the experience, vision, innovation and talent to scale client operations globally and accelerate their digital transformation. Digital transformation enabled by providing a secure foundation “Going digital” can be a compelling event. Enterprises performing transformations are the leading factor driving public cloud engagement and adoption today. Regulatory pressures, sprawling IT estates, advances in technology, a world of ever- present challenges to security and stability, and new business models are compelling our clients to become more agile, in a manner that reduces barriers, increases response velocity and provides them with more flexibility in how they respond to systemic threats, changing marketplaces and their customer demands. From a business perspective, clients are focusing on innovation, agility and automation as a means to facilitate faster time to value with no loss of service delivery. Clients must evolve legacy technology systems, processes, applications and thinking to survive. As clients begin to adapt their processes to a digital context, GRC, SecOps and BCM technologies can provide the scale, structure and speed needed to deliver operationally resilient enterprises. Cloud platform services are the foundation for this resilient, agile business world. It’s the platform that enables coherence, while cloud-based services are key to delivering flexible, on-demand access to the resources underpinning new business offerings. GRC, SecOps and BCM platform services allow organizations to define their approach and response to resilience challenges in an efficient and compliant way, bringing financial savings and operational confidence. Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes, not cloud technology. Our conversations must focus on business, organization and financials. We need to validate that clients are making IT investments that align with their business strategy. This narrative shows the potential arc of a business outcome conversation with a client. Organizations look to the public cloud as a way to go digital. Potentially, costs and the required skills to maintain multiple platforms can increase. Organizations need a blend of industry knowledge and platform knowledge to co-create secure digital experiences. DXC is a digital transformation partner. We simplify complex IT support and operations to help clients focus on their core business. DXC has industrialized IT automation built into our platforms. We continue to build on this automated foundation. We help clients launch and adopt cloud and platform solutions and then scale it to their business. 7 Building Operational Security & Resilience 8DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve We want to help clients strengthen their ability to deal with internal and external GRC and SecOps threats and challenges and prove their compliance. Leverage our domain and technical expertise as required. • Define a proof of concept, business case and plan • Define the high-level approach: DXC can design, implement and then run, only design and implement or just design or implement or run, in line with business objectives and regulatory mandates • Position on a DXC or customer instance and then manage as a program with clear KPIs that define what success looks like • Produce an organizational reference data layer — departments, locations, assets, services levering the platform. Identify target legislation, policies and controls. Address security, policies, processes, plans, risk and governance. • Use prebuilt content to accelerate time to value for GRC and SecOps; retire or integrate existing tools or platforms to either save or justify expenditure; prove business value using outcomes and KPIs as per business case • Produce a list of linked business assets, vendors, contracts and services with criticality and owners • Research and decide on applicable legislation • Produce an agreed, quantified enterprise risk and enterprise policy framework • Link policies, controls and risks • Produce a vendor risk and vendor performance assessment program • Research and define an organizational security posture, including BCP/DR provisions • Design a security architecture that aligns with the posture and ServiceNow platform • Use the ServiceNow platform to integrate disparate GRC and SecOps technologies and processes • Produce a management information layer that drives business outcomes correctly and coalesces relevant information from all GRC and SecOps What’s the conversation? Most clients lack operational resilience. They are coping with increasing volumes and velocities of regulation and threats, with hybridized estates of legacy and cloud infrastructure. The classic silos of behavior and oversight are all too evident. This brings a slow, fragmented management approach, all of which bring operational fragility. To resolve, a combination of high-quality underlying organizational data along with agreed and coherent policies, processes, workflows in one platform to help bring people together and guide their actions are required. Client problems • Time to manage risk and compliance is excessive — Regulatory complexity/unknown regulatory scope and operational governance are managed using spreadsheets and emails, causing large overheads. • Growing regulatory backlog — Organizations are under growing pressure to change and respond faster to internal and external policy demands. • Vendors are bringing risk to organizations — An increasing propensity to outsource critical processes brings systemic risk in case of vendor failure. • Silo-based approach— Risk, compliance, audit, SecOps, vendor and contract management teams operate in their own silos, bringing a disjointed and slow approach. • Operational burden and complexity — Clients are unable to manage current GRC and SecOps environment efficiently, costs are increasing and there is a mismatch of technical skills. There is also an increasing number of technical problems that take too long to fix. • Security threats are increasing in volume and velocity — Security threats are increasing in their number and the time to exploit weaknesses. Combined with increased fines from regulators for breaches, this can pose existential risks. • Organizations don’t understand the real-world impact of security — Too much guesswork, hope and ignorance is being used to “protect” organizations. There is an inability to locate and retire legacy applications and technologies in case of breaches. • Organizations don’t have relevant expertise — Understanding the domains of regulations and security is extremely time-, resource- and labor-intensive.

Building Operational Security & Resilience 13 DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch In any operation, worker safety is paramount. While many applications exist for reporting incidents, hazards and risks, the cloud-based HSE suite gives everyone in an operation access to the tools and information they need to go beyond reporting and to proactively mitigate potential problems. HSE is packed with features that advance the ability to identify risks and efficiently respond to, investigate and manage incidents when and where they occur. DXC helps clients in two ways: • Organizations looking for a better way to manage health, safety and environmental issues will find rapid time to value without sacrificing, or limiting, potential return on investment and the ability to transform their incident tracking. HSE does this through a global incident view, fostering a safety culture and proactive mitigation prioritization. • Armed with data and information, companies can quickly make a business case for the funding required to ensure a safe working environment. CFOs will not only appreciate the prioritized list of necessary spending required to ensure workers’ well-being but also the cost reduction from improved health, safety and environmental outcomes. Digital transformation enabled by improving business processes through technology Prioritizing spending for hazard mitigation can be tough and time consuming — but not when you have the operation-wide, real-time reporting capabilities of the DXC Health, Safety and Environmental Management Suite (HSE) product. Customize your view, set up automated reporting and analyze data to make well-founded decisions based on complete information. Armed with data and information, you can quickly make a business case for the funding you need to ensure a safe environment. Your CFO will not only appreciate the prioritized list of necessary spending required to ensure your workers’ well-being but also the cost reduction from improved health, safety and environmental outcomes. The enhanced ability to identify root cause issues and apply appropriate mitigation are the key to success in driving production efficiency and improved customer service. In addition, global safety and security regulations now require frequent reporting. Automation of those reporting processes is key to timely submission, better safety protocols and improved reputation on social media. Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes and flexibility. Our conversations must focus on business agility, organization and financials. We need to validate that clients are making IT investments that align with their business strategy. This narrative shows the potential arc of a business outcome conversation with a client.

Corporate Incident Response 15 DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve DXC’s Health, Safety and Environmental application can be implemented into any ServiceNow environment if the client is an existing ServiceNow customer. The application is downloaded from the store and is typically installed as part of an overall consulting engagement. The product will help solve the following challenges: • Risk mitigation – Provides identification of high-risk areas; actual/potential causes and trends – Real-time data and reporting enables quick and solid analysis for prioritizing investment and spend • Reporting – Holistic solution, including best-in-class, real-time event tracking that fosters a safety culture through better awareness, worker engagement and visibility to data across facilities and regions • Automated compliance reporting – Workmen's Compensation, accident and injury as mandated by most countries and some UN conventions • Stable cash flow – Flexible and scalable cloud-based solution maximizing ROI by reducing unpredictable incident and maintenance costs and by improving employee and workplace health and safety • Root causes and trend analysis – Decision analysis and review capability for incidents and near misses to identify and address training, equipment and design issues in work areas Commercial considerations • Structure as an annual program with measurable business case objectives. • Client funds core simplify/optimize engagement, pays for individual projects and receives benefit from each project. • Where DXC assumes financial risk, gain share model may be appropriate. • The target annual savings should be in the range of 10%-20% of a client’s overall IT budget. • For smaller accounts, a programmatic approach may not be justified — need to proceed commercially, project by project. What’s the conversation? At DXC we recognize that safe, environmentally responsible operations not only save lives and reduce cost but add organizational value by providing a foundation for identifying new business opportunities and enhancing existing operations through consistent process documentation and risk mitigation. In addition, reporting, risk of civil penalties, potential fines and public opinion are always existential threats to not only profitability but potentially the existence of the organization. Community awareness and messaging are critical aspects of any modern enterprise. Whether your organization uses social media or not, it has a strong impact on your customers and competitors. Unplanned environmental or safety events can have an immediate, negative impact on the organization's bottom line if not managed proactively. The first step in successful social media message control is access to timely, coordinated and accurate incident information, quickly presented to media experts to help them mitigate damage and craft a story beneficial to the organization. DXC’s cloud-based health and safety tool is the best option for minimizing the innate risks of company operations. It provides deep insights into organizational strengths and weaknesses and allows leadership to quickly identify root-cause issues that can then be treated to optimize success. Client problems DXC’s HSE application provides a unified view of the challenges and risks associated with business operations. This central repository allows for prompt and effective changes to processes to prevent accident, injury and environmental hazard. Many companies today face similar struggles with their operational health and safety programs, often with the following common problems: • Incident tracking on multiple spreadsheets; no operation-wide view of incidents, risks and hazards – Lack of centralized reporting allows the “big picture” to be lost • Lack of real-time reporting, data not centralized; legacy solutions on premise – Legacy solutions on site can fail and delay reporting and process improvement • Root-cause analysis cannot be easily assessed – All successful safety programs rely on root cause analysis for process and procedural change • Compliance audits can require a large effort and become disruptive • Difficulty recognizing negative trends or warning signs Customer Conversation: Corporate incident response 1 2 15 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch DXC designs, deploys and secures new cloud and platform solutions at scale that can be integrated with a client’s IT estate to produce better business outcomes. As clients undertake cloud adoption and digital transformation, they face challenges in scaling and managing their new solutions while successfully integrating them with their existing IT landscape. DXC helps clients in three ways: • We simplify and optimize their IT and non-IT estate using automation and continuous optimization to deliver savings that fund digital initiatives. • Second, we modernize their existing environment by adapting legacy applications to the cloud while also integrating, operating and securing their legacy and multi-cloud environments at scale, enabling clients to unlock the business value in legacy applications. • Finally, we transform the IT function to enable the client’s business agenda through a secure, platform-centric digital foundation. We have the experience, vision, innovation and talent to scale client operations globally and accelerate their digital transformation. Digital transformation enabled by replacing legacy technologies “Going digital” can be a compelling event. Enterprises performing transformations are the leading factor driving public cloud engagement and adoption today. Market pressures, advances in technology and new business models are compelling our clients to become more agile in a manner that reduces barriers and provides them with more flexibility in how they respond to the changing marketplace and their customer demand. From a business perspective, clients are focusing on innovation, agility and automation as a means to facilitate faster time to value. Clients must evolve legacy technology systems and applications to survive. As clients begin to adapt their processes to a digital context, application development platforms can provide the scale and speed needed to deliver transformation. Application development platform services are the foundation for this new agile business world. It’s the platform that enables agile application development, while cloud-based services are key to delivering flexible, on-demand access to the resources underpinning new business offerings. Application development platform services allow organizations to scale their IT solutions to support changing business priorities while reducing the risks of wasted IT resources that inhibit investments in new digital solutions. Application development platform services form the foundation of digital transformation and can facilitate rapid and secure business change.  Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes and agility. Our conversations must focus on business agility, organization and financials. We need to validate that clients are making IT investments that align with their business strategy. This narrative shows the potential arc of a business outcome conversation with a client. Organizations look to low-code application development as a way to go digital. Potentially, development costs and the required skills to develop and maintain multiple applications can increase. Organizations need a blend of industry knowledge and application development knowledge to co-create secure digital experiences. DXC is a digital transformation and industrialization partner. We simplify application development to help clients focus on their core business. DXC has industrialized IT knowledge and experience. We continue to build industry-specific COTS applications. We help clients launch and adopt application development platform solutions and then scale them to their business. 17 Business Process Automation 18DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve We want to help clients remove IT complexity and waste so they can refocus their resources on accelerating value-based business outcomes. Target complexity and inefficiencies at the source. Address security, policies and governance. Identify target services to assess, define a proof of concept, business case and plan and then manage as a program with clear KPIs that define what success looks like. Clients should consider a low-code application development platform when aiming to replatform their legacy application estates and making application development decisions. Example levers to simplify and optimize: • Rationalize redundant and underutilized applications • Optimize IT governance and controls for greater simplicity • Take control of the application life cycle • Continuously optimize developer resources to demand • Implement low-code application development platform technology • Optimize workload placement (on premises or on public cloud) • Eliminate legacy technologies and outdated applications • Look to refresh software to modern technology application development platforms and architectures Commercial considerations • Structure as an annual program with measurable business case objectives. • Client funds core simplify/optimize engagement, pays for individual projects and receives benefit from each project. • Where DXC assumes financial risk, gain share model may be appropriate. • The target annual savings should be in the range of 10%-20% of a client’s overall IT budget. • For smaller accounts, a programmatic approach may not be justified — need to proceed commercially, project by project. What’s the conversation? As clients industrialize and prepare to use an application development platform, this can prevent them from focusing on their strategic agenda. They are coping with legacy technologies, applications and IT estates that are becoming more difficult to manage and are therefore dealing with increased operational expenses and the need for stronger governance. The existing burden of legacy applications build using legacy high-code development technologies is holding them back, and it’s hard to find skilled development resources and keep up with the current demand for change of the business. If not proactively addressed, it drives up costs, reduces quality and slows the pace of change and time to market. Clients want to reduce their legacy technology dependencies and increase their agility and ability to change and serve the business/customer better and faster. Clients aim to simplify and optimize their IT by rationalizing, standardizing application development while addressing maintainability and sustainability at the same time. Client problems • Time to execute change is too long — System complexity and technical debt often drive this reality. An enterprise IT organization is often perceived as unable to respond to the LOB requests fast enough or that IT is struggling to meet the LOB demands. • End of service life — Clients don’t keep up with tech refresh cycles, incurring large maintenance and development costs. • Technical debt — Outdated infrastructure and applications, sweating of applications (technical debt) and continuing to chase obsolescence. • Growing backlog — Organizations are under a growing pressure to change and respond faster to customer and LOB demand. • Operational burden and complexity — Inability to manage current application development environment efficiently, costs increasing, mismatch of technical skills and increasing number of technical problems that take too long to fix. • No time to innovate — Often the budget is consumed by legacy development, scarce and costly resources and keep-the-lights-on, which represents 70 — 80% of the spend. • Change is the only constant — Costs are too high, and clients are unable to divert resources to new innovation; inability to locate and retire legacy applications and technologies.

What capabilities do you need to improve your organization’s alignment with business needs? Diagnostic questions Usage scenario How big is your project backlog? Does the backlog solely comprise changes to existing apps or also brand-new apps? What types of projects are getting higher priority from the business? Would you say your team is behind in terms of delivery timelines? When addressing the business app backlog could delivery times be reduced if your teams could build and change apps in weeks vs. months (using a visual approach)? Has the business ever come to you with their own prototype/ experimental app? Are your teams proposing business innovation through exploratory projects? How often does your team deliver a prototype for the business to validate and evaluate a new idea? What is the average turnaround time for your team to deliver a working prototype? While experimenting with new business ideas could they be realized faster if your teams created working prototypes that can directly evolve to live applications? Describe your current feedback loop or mechanism between the business end users and development teams. Do your business stakeholders feel like they are not being understood by your development teams? Do your development teams find the business requirements and change requests to be lacking detail? How much time and resources are wasted on rework due to miscommunication? When collaborating with the business could the feedback loop be improved with IT if the business users provided contextual feedback directly in the app? How does your organization adopt new development technologies? What is your strategy to overcome your organization's natural resistance to change? What changes to your team do you think are needed to successfully adopt a faster way of delivering? How will you prepare the business to keep up with your team's new delivery speed?

What changes to your team do you think are needed to successfully adopt a faster way of delivering? How does your organization adopt new development technologies? What is your strategy to overcome your organization's natural resistance to change? How will you prepare the business to keep up with your team's new delivery speed? When implementing a DT strategy with the business, could planning time be reduced and chances of a quick success be increased if your team and the business used playbooks that laid out best practices to accelerate app delivery and adoption? Is customer engagement part of your DT strategy? How are you keeping up with UI/UX expectations of your clients? Are you able to provide a consistent experience across all channels and apps? Do you have a reusable UX plan or guidelines for all new initiatives or is this done fresh for each new project? When creating new apps, could the execution of your DT strategy be improved if your team could deliver apps in a fraction of the time without compromising branding and UX? What percent of the current business requests are mobile apps versus web apps (or possibly both)? How does mobility fit into your DT strategy? Is your business increasingly asking for more advanced mobile features, offline mobile apps, use of native device features? How are you addressing the increasing pressure to accommodate BYOD (bring your own device) from your business? Are you prepared for that many platforms? When faced with business requests that have multiple delivery channels, could these projects be delivered in less time if the same resource could build web and mobile apps simultaneously? Are you a Forrester client? Have you seen the latest analyst (Forrester) reports and evaluations on ___? How many new technologies do you think you will adopt as part of your DT? Are you using any outside DT advisors or consultants? Would you feel more secure knowing you were partnering with the pioneer of the low code? When setting out on your DT journey, could risk be reduced if your organization partnered with the proven industry-leading solution for creating apps to support your DT? 21 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

As clients accelerate their digital transformation journey, IT has a strategic role to transform the way employees consume enterprise services, including IT, HR, finance, procurement, facility, legal and marketing. Coming from a fragmented service delivery approach, our clients need to streamline design, build, test and run activities (production) while structuring new product or services innovation roadmap and better managing business relationship and customer satisfaction. DXC ServiceNow Center of Excellence brings certainty on quality of delivery through SLAs and KPIs aligned with expected business outcomes.

Center of Excellence as a lever to transform ServiceNow platform to enterprise service management In many companies, business and IT go their separate ways once the implementation of the ServiceNow project is complete. To get enduring results, the business must drive the ongoing improvements needed for the ServiceNow platform to become a true enterprise service management platform. It is the business — supported by IT — that needs to identify the process changes, reporting for decision-making and end-user needs on an ongoing basis. The ServiceNow Center of Excellence requires a mix of process owners within the business community, business relationship manager, functional application experts, architects and technical experts. In addition, the delivery team needs leaders to drive innovation and develop ServiceNow platform outreach within the business. Overall, the ServiceNow Center of Excellence is a fantastic opportunity for IT to better align with business needs and fuel enterprise service management innovation across the organization, helping break silos between IT and non-IT organizations (HR, finance, procurement, facility, etc.). Our narrative Clients want to focus on the business value the ServiceNow platform can bring to the organization. Our conversations must focus on industrialization, innovation and cost reduction and build intimacy with the business. The employee experience is at the center of today’s enterprise. Whether it’s process, technology, infrastructure or innovation, lines of business from IT to HR and beyond are addressing issues by putting the employee and customer experience first.

The Center of Excellence enables fast-paced reactive and proactive responses to business needs. The Center of Excellence provides business and application expertise to support an organization's global or domestic ServiceNow implementation by designing new processes, optimizing current ones, managing complex implementation projects, providing user support and training, and keeping the ServiceNow system landscape up and running 24/7. In addition, the Center of Excellence helps optimize the use of all ServiceNow products implemented in a cost-effective manner, contributing to the overall company's success. Some of the key functions and benefits of the COE: • A standard vehicle for deploying ServiceNow best practices • A central point of contact for all ServiceNow-related matters • Development of strong competencies in all ServiceNow areas • Enhances the value of the ServiceNow solution; more standardization and better integration • Improvements in user productivity and employee experience • Reduced cost of ServiceNow operations (TCO) • Improved retention of key ServiceNow personnel • Improved service levels Commercial considerations • The CoE offering covers end-to-end ServiceNow platform life cycle management, structuring multi-million dollar and multi-year contract. • DXC could provide a pay-as-you-go pricing model for CoE, allowing clients to pay according to the actual volume of services consumed. • Adopt programmatic approach and proactive joint proposal with ServiceNow where DXC/ServiceNow has developed business value framework. • Consider win back for accounts where DXC was close to win. What’s the conversation? Clients have been struggling to deliver on time, on quality and on budget the ServiceNow platform projects and run, whether to transform IT or non-IT organization, processes and tools. They want to deliver faster and improve the customer experience while reducing costs and risks. They need to accelerate value delivered to the business through better quality management and de-risk project delivery go-live commitments while controlling budgets. As organizations mature, the focus shifts from tactical only to the strategic thoughts of “what business value can we bring with the enterprise service management platform.” The framework should include everything from strategic planning and roadmap to tactical execution. Both are important to measure value delivered to the business. Without a plan in place to scale the platform as the company grows, it can be difficult to demonstrate its value. If a client is struggling to manage its ServiceNow platform while seeking investor or committee support, it is crucial to ramp up and rationalize platform governance. Proper governance of the ServiceNow program will help steer the program as follows : • Understand business demand and strategic business outcomes to define platform strategy • Business demand prioritization against value delivered will shape platform roadmap • Established standards drive execution in delivery of service and continuous service improvement (CSI) • Business KPIs will steer ServiceNow Center of Excellence while constantly measuring value delivered to the business and customer satisfaction Client problems • Skills: Finding the right skills and talents in a stretched market where good resources are missing • Governance: Governing and steering ServiceNow projects with heterogeneous project management discipline to meet timeframe, quality and budget • Accountability: Multiple service providers on projects dilute accountability and make projects difficult to steer properly while putting additional workload and accountability on clients to manage this complexity and lack of drive • Visibility: Lack or limited visibility on new product/service roadmap to be able to structure delivery teams proactively • Proactivity: No or limited business relationship management governance to manage innovation roadmap and expectations with the business, and structure demand pipeline to plan delivery requirements • Benefits: Poor budget actuals creating pressure to reduce ambition on new services opportunities Customer Conversation: Service Management Center of Excellence 1 2 24DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch Organizations are transforming their IT department to enable their digital journey of delivering faster and improved customer experience while reducing costs and risks. This transformation creates a fundamentally different IT ecosystem (e.g., multi-vendor cloud) with a new way of working such as agile and DevOps. Organizations need to realize they need to rethink the way they manage their IT ecosystem and take a more holistic approach to IT management across the entire IT value chain. DXC helps clients in three ways: • We simplify and optimize the IT value chain, using automation and continuous optimization, to deliver savings that fund digital initiatives. • Second, we modernize the existing IT management tool chain (e.g., introduce new way of working such as DevOps and multi-cloud management). • Finally, we transform the IT function to enable the clients’ business agenda through a secure, platform-centric digital management foundation. Our dedicated Management of Change team supports the change from a people perspective, assuring awareness and smooth adoption of the change. We have the experience, vision, innovation and talent to scale client operations globally and accelerate their digital transformation. Digital transformation of IT management with the IT4IT standard Market pressures, advances in technology and new business models are compelling our clients to become more agile in a manner that reduces barriers and provides them with more flexibility in how they respond to the changing marketplace and their customer demand. From a business perspective, clients are focusing on innovation, agility and automation as a means to facilitate faster time to value. To enable these digital challenges a new digital management capability is needed to create a more integrated and value stream approach to plan, build, deploy and manage digital offerings. This new digital management ecosystem is characterized by: • More components (e.g. IOT, cloud, APIs) • More vendors • More changes (due to continuous delivery) • More compliance policies (e.g. GDPR) • More security events • Monitor IT data e.g. monitoring and log data Most organizations now realize they need to transform their IT organization to manage this new digital reality covering DevOps, agile development, self-service and automating IT activities. Digitalization of IT management using the IT4IT standard from The Open Group is becoming a prerequisite for enabling digital transformation. Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes and agility. Our conversations must focus on business agility, organization and financials. We need to validate that clients are making IT investments that align with their business strategy. This narrative shows the potential arc of a business outcome conversation with a client. IT organizations have to manage complex IT systems, processes and data under business pressures to reduce costs, increase speed and bring innovation. We help IT organizations manage the new digital ecosystem with an increasing number of vendors, technologies, etc. The IT4IT standard is the end-to-end integrated digital framework needed to transform the IT function to be more cost efficient and deliver faster with lower risk. DXC has all the experience and skills to build an integrated IT management capability. We simplify IT management to help clients focus on their core business.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow What’s the conversation? The complicated and extensive IT landscapes in modern enterprises are critical to business success but are increasingly challenging to manage. As many organizations transform their way of working, (e.g., introduce agile development, DevOps and move applications to the cloud) they also need to define a new vision and strategy for their IT management ecosystem (organization, processes and IT management tool landscape). IT management systems, processes and data that are not aligned to a single integrated framework introduce unnecessary costs, unacceptable risks and avoidable delays, all which impact business competitiveness. Clients want to deliver faster and improve customer experience while reducing costs and risks. More and more organizations realize they need to create a modern IT management capability — rationalizing, standardizing and automating their IT management tool chain. IT4IT is an IT industry standard for managing “the business of IT” that provides a digital framework with which to consolidate systems to reduce costs, create a single version of common data to reduce risks and integrate processes to accelerate IT delivery to the business. Client problems • Complexity — Complex IT management tooling landscape with fragmented tools, processes and data; creating an integrated DevOps pipeline is complex; many initiatives to improve the IT function • Data — A lot of IT data but lacking transparency and traceability; no real-time insight into costs, risk, customer experience and performance; no insight for continuous improvement • Manual activities — IT organizations still have too many manual activities • Value — Inability to demonstrate value of IT services for the business Customer Conversation: Run IT as a business 1 2 DXC’s point of view on how to solve We help our clients streamline and automate IT processes across the entire IT value chain from “idea” to “production” by creating a modern IT operating model based upon the IT4IT standard. Optimizing IT management starts with a business case. DXC has world-leading experts, unique tools (assessments, simulations, references) and the experience needed to build a thorough and viable investment case, a target blueprint and a transformation roadmap. Based on that roadmap the transformation can be phased with the highest impact aspects going earlier to provide the savings and benefits to support the later phases. The implementation sequence is always tailored to the specific starting point and objectives of the client. Example levers to optimize • Define an IT management vision and strategy • Define an IT management architecture (based on the IT4IT standard) • Simplify and consolidate complex, fragmented and costly IT management landscape • Modernize the current IT management landscape to be suitable for the new way of working (deliver in the cloud, continuous deployment, manage security risks, etc.) • Improve the quality of IT management data, e.g., make CMDB up to date, license management, service portfolio, etc. • Automate more IT management activities to eliminate many manual IT management activities • Gain cost insight; allocate costs based on actual consumption • Implement integrated services/application portfolio and self-service catalog (self service/self help); focus on people using management of change practices • Move from reactive to proactive monitoring and automate event response • Consolidate the many fragmented initiatives to improve the IT function 29 DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Run IT as a Business 30DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Client problems (cont'd) • Long lead time to deliver new functionality or resolve issues • Missing bigger picture — Many fragmented IT management initiatives • Adoptions — Ensuring people in the organization adopt the new way of working Customer Conversation: Run IT as a business 1 2 Commercial considerations Create a long-term strategic relationship with the client to co-create a target blueprint and roadmap. Set up IT4IT architectural involvement (with a DXC IT4IT architect at the client’s enterprise architecture department). All-at-once adoption and implementation of IT4IT for an enterprise is a high-cost, high-risk decision, so pitch in the following way: 1. Think big — adopt the IT4IT framework as your IT management standard and use the IT4IT assessment to create a target blueprint and roadmap for the ideal end state 2. Start small — choose the highest-impact (cost, risk, value) component of the framework to start with and use that success to drive support for the next component 3. Act fast — a complicated multi-year roadmap must deliver substantial near-term benefits to be viable  The target annual savings of the IT4IT program is in the range of 10% of a client’s overall IT budget. Offer “IT management as a service” to the client to reduce entry cost for the client, gain “instant” digitalization and get to IT standards more quickly. DXC FP takes accountability for desimplementing, operating and supporting the transformed IT management solution for the client on a subscription basis, leaving the client more able to focus more on IT that improves business revenue, profitability and market share. Look to offset the client-perceived risk of buying into a multi-year IT management transformation program based on IT4IT with annual checkpoints on ROI and value, which then justifies continuing if a managed service or strategic program approach is not achievable (e.g., due to governance issues); proceed on a project-by-project basis to build up client confidence. 30DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Run IT as a Business 31 DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Objection handling “We already do all of this stuff ourselves”: Doing each of the aspects of IT management well is a good start but unless they are all based on a unifying blueprint, IT management cannot be consolidated, integrated and automated to optimize efficiency, effectiveness and quality of the end-to-end outcomes. DXC has the expertise, experience and capability to drive that next level of optimization for your IT function. “This is too big, too risky and too disruptive for us to buy into”: Adopting the IT4IT framework is low cost and low risk. From there we can assess for a specific customer where the largest gains can be delivered fastest and develop a roadmap that fits with the investment objectives, appetite for risk and maturity of the client. That way we can gain lower-risk early wins to validate the approach and in some cases provide funding for the next phases. All phases will deliver benefits individually but more importantly amplify the collective benefits from all phases, because they are all part of the same integrated IT4IT framework. “We don’t want locked into a proprietary multi-year roadmap with a specific supplier”: IT4IT is an IT industry standard independently managed by the Open Group. Everything we do will be aligned to the standard, making it easily transferable to internal IT or another partner if that becomes necessary. “We are a global enterprise with many business units, and we can’t manage the internal change to transform our IT management”: Reorienting the IT function and end users to accept a new way of working is a real challenge. DXC FP can draw upon extensive experience in management of change to support the transition. “We’ve already adopted ITIL and the other standards, why do we need another one?”: IT4IT is the unifying framework that combines, aligns and integrates other IT standards. IT4IT pulls these other standards into a full end-to-end framework across the complete IT life cycle and for all IT activities. IT4IT defines the common data model that should be used for the whole IT life cycle and goes down to the level of detail required to actually implement the standard. Customer Conversation: Discovery, overcoming objections and key messages 1 2 Discovery Q&A Q. Do you have a complete picture of your current IT management people, processes, tools, data, integrations and controls and how much all of that costs to operate? A. Typically IT management landscapes grow up organically over time with a number of best-of-breed systems with overlapping functionality exchanging and converting data over complex and fragile customized interfaces. Using IT4IT as the reference standard it is possible to simplify, consolidate and optimize all of these aspects to save money and improve outcomes. Q. Do you have a vision and strategy for your target IT management blueprint in terms of your transition to DevOps, agile development, CI/CD and cloud? A. Using IT4IT as the reference standard it is possible to systematically understand, simplify, consolidate and optimize all aspects of your IT management activities to save money and improve IT and business outcomes. Q. Can you see in real time how your IT activities are performing across internal IT teams and external suppliers and pinpoint where you need to take action to remediate issues? A. IT4IT connects all the IT management systems, processes, data and teams together in an integrated end-to-end framework. This allows IT leaders to see what the IT function is doing minute by minute across end-to-end activities between multiple suppliers and take action. Q. Is it a challenge to achieve and maintain consensus between IT and business stakeholders and teams on the challenges, objectives and opportunities for the IT function and to effectively prioritize the most valuable initiatives? A. The IT4IT standard provides an industry best-practice target state for organizations to head toward, and the end- to-end view it provides allows IT investment decisions to be taken in the context of the project, demand and operational support consequences that will result. Q. Can you be confident that your IT management practices will pass security and compliance controls audits? A. Typically it is very difficult to self-assess compliance and assurance readiness ahead of formal audits. Using IT4IT to define how data is structured, stored and modified and an integrated workflow system like ServiceNow to control and automate access to that data, the risk of non-compliance is greatly reduced and capabilities such as continuous controls compliance through rules-based automation can take a more proactive stance toward controls compliance. Q. Is your IT organization spending a lot more time, budget and effort on managing IT rather than creating value with the business? A. Typical IT operations organizations focus up to 80% of their efforts on non-differentiating IT management activities (IT incidents, changes and requests) and much less on differentiating IT activities (data analytics, financial risk, supply chain automation, etc.) that directly improve business bottom line and market share. By adopting the IT4IT and automating standard workflows all using the same shared data, the burden of managing IT can be greatly reduced (or eliminated by outsourcing), allowing the IT function to focus on partnering with the business to innovate and create new value. 31 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

PROBLEM SOLUTION VALUE Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow 34DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve We want to help clients build on an existing or planned investment in ServiceNow and gain further value from that investment by implementing the ServiceNow Cloud Management Platform (CMP). ServiceNow CMP delivers agility across clouds with automated governance, integration with existing ITSM processes to ensure operational risks are managed consistently, and visibility is provided to optimize cloud spend and assure compliance with policies and standards. Integrating with all major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP and VMware), CMP brings the capability to integrate and operationalize any client cloud investment. Examples to define, change and manage: • Discuss and understand clients' existing cloud strategy and ServiceNow plans. • Examine current plans and pain points in cloud adoption and application migration. • Plan an approach to use ServiceNow CMP to address current and future needs in cloud management. • Consult on definition of an operating model that clarifies responsibilities for IT service and security operations teams with ServiceNow CMP configuration and the native cloud platform teams. • Understand corporate policies and standards needed for automation to support CMP delivery. • Identify priority compliance and financial control reporting needs. Commercial considerations • Structure as a phased program with measurable business case objectives. • Ensure baselines measured to determine ROI — agility, cost, compliance • Client funds and receives benefit from each phase of the project. • Where DXC assumes financial risk, gain-share model may be appropriate. • The target is to substantially reduce the workload for staff and customers as well. • Link work to existing ServiceNow or cloud programs to leverage investment and improve ROI. What’s the conversation? As clients undertake cloud adoption as part of digital transformation, they face challenges in scaling, governing and managing their new solutions and recognize the need to successfully integrate them with existing IT operational tools and processes. IT CIOs are demanding the agility benefit of cloud while the organization still demands strict adherence to corporate policies and standards and needs to be assured that service quality and financial controls remain intact. In essence, the challenge is to deliver the flexibility, economics and faste time-to-market of cloud, without compromising on operational and commercial integrity. Client problems • Time to deliver new IT services is too long — Legacy technical, commercial and operational controls lead to excessive delivery times for new services. Silo-based delivery approach not working. • Moving to fully scaled production services in the Cloud — Clients are moving from experimentation with cloud services and need to move to operate cloud at scale alongside legacy environments. • Achieving the benefits of Cloud — Clients are failing to deliver the benefits of application migration. Adoption is still below aspirations, and net benefits are not being achieved at the pace required. • Risk and compliance management in the cloud — Regulatory complexity/unknown regulatory scope and operational governance are typically managed manually using spreadsheets and emails, causing large overheads and further reducing cloud benefits. • Building new skills and capability — Clients are looking to new ways of working with cloud through DevOps operating models and agile methodologies.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Digital transformation enabled by cloud technologies Human resources is experiencing unprecedented disruption brought about by the digital economy paradigm shift. Competition for top talent is fierce. This, in turn, is requiring a reinvention of human capital management (HCM) to innovate, adapt, optimize and disrupt their current business models. Human resources service delivery is a cloud solution that integrates with on-prem solutions and within a few years all HCM solutions will move to the cloud. Innovative business models depend on robust, equally innovative employment models. To enable the promise of digital requires rethinking how HR enables the business with a holistic mobile employee engagement view. As enterprises move to implement the digital foundation required in the transformation journey, a focus on attaining a more agile and competitive organization is imperative. Many traditional enterprises struggle to prioritize the cloud HCM solution roadmap. • When to migrate to the cloud? • What solutions need to be implemented sooner rather than later? • Are new mobile consumer experience-grade technologies emerging? Forward-thinking HR leaders are tracking and measuring the capabilities and effectiveness of HCM solutions. The days of validating outdated data, maintaining spreadsheets and communicating with time-consuming methods is transitioning with transparent cloud capabilities. DXC’s HR approach to moving applications to the cloud is centered on best-in-class HCM solutions (Oracle, SAP SuccessFactors, ServiceNow HRSD and Workday) that address enterprise concerns and challenges. DXC has the expertise to manage the transitions and enable self-service, mobile employee capabilities with HR service delivery cloud applications.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch DXC realizes that today’s CHRO is faced with balancing ever-changing employee and client expectations. As the urgency for digital transformation accelerates, the CHRO must align and keep a critical forward-thinking focus. Providing the digital tools that are needed to enable growth and success will impact future organizational growth. As HR continues to guide the organization, a constant challenge of their own thinking of their roles as leaders must be studied. Old-school ways of task-burdened emails, telephone tag, spreadsheets, disparate systems and lack of transparency must be replaced with agility and capability. It’s a new way of looking at the workforce of the future and driving organizational change to meet the challenges ahead. Impacting the workplace is the new dominance of a younger generation. This is a game changer for human resources. To recruit, attract, develop and retain a workforce of tech-savvy, mobile-enabled and self-reliant learners, organizations must focus on modernizing the approach with digital capabilities. DXC is here to help guide our clients drive digital transformation as a strategic imperative. DXC helps clients to increase operational efficiency by reimagining HR to simplify, modernize and transform in several key ways that address pain points with solution enablement for the organization: • Improve employee engagement — Providing employees with modern digital methods to quickly interact, obtain knowledge and solve problems increases organization productivity • Automate HR processes — Automation reduces the number of manual processes, spreadsheet tracking, email and phone exchanges, enabling HR to standardize the global needs of the business • Manage compliance and risk — Analytics and reports provide HR with transparency and understanding to guide the future needs of the organization • HCM suite and HRSD integration — Seamless third-party on-prem and cloud integrations enable HR to standardize the global needs of the business 3 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve We want to help clients remove organizational complexity so they can refocus their resources on accelerating value-based business outcomes. Target complexity and inefficiencies at the process level. Address employee enablement, HR security and compliance requirements, define proof of concept, business case for change and short-term/long-term strategic plan, and then manage as a program with clear KPIs that define what success looks like. Clients will need to consider the inevitable cloud-first approach when aiming to optimize HR impact to the organization. Example levers to simplify and optimize: • Improve employee satisfaction by making it easier for employees with elevated mobile digital support • Develop great leaders and talent, enabling them with technology • Identify processes and workflows that must be automated, which requires a reinvented HR • Build out a strategy that includes intelligent automation • Target communication with a strategic organizational change management (OCM) plan • Transition HR professionals to become strategists and minimize administrative tasks through automation Opportunity progression Commercial considerations • Structure as an annual program with measurable business case objectives. • Client funds core simplify/optimize engagement, pays for individual projects and receives benefit from each project. • Where DXC assumes financial risk, gain share model may be appropriate. • The target annual savings should be in the range of 10% - 20% of a client’s overall IT budget. • For smaller accounts, a programmatic approach may not be justified — need to proceed commercially, project by project. What’s the conversation? We at DXC recognize that the world around HR clients is changing at an unprecedented pace. Human resources is evaluating the needed skills and retooling the organization with new skillsets that include a digital approach to HR. They understand the need to keep their organization future-proof and able to respond in time to any future challenges. How do clients keep pace with the demand from the internal and external clients? For DXC clients, it’s not about getting to the cloud per se; it is about how their organization will drive the digital transformation to meet the challenge. Cloud is the only sustainable deployment choice for HR long term. DXC’s HR service delivery is the best choice in the market for targeting the “war on talent” and executing HR strategic plans. Clients will need to future-proof HR, and DXC is best in class to help our clients make that digital transformation shift. We know HR service delivery best and provide tools, assets and services to enable our clients with new digital processes for holistic organizational HR success. Client problems HCM core on-prem solutions are transitioning to the cloud. As that happens, the ability to drive consumer-like, employee-centered mobile enablement via HR service delivery is a competitive advantage. HRSD targets the war on talent and enablement of organizational success. Here are a few questions that may be asked and value drivers to consider: • Can we implement a secure service delivery model for case and knowledge management in the cloud with our on-prem core HCM platform? • Retaining and engaging new employees has become challenging. How does HRSD enable this process? • HCM recruiting platforms lack the capability to pre-onboard employees and requires many manual administrative steps in the process. How do we leverage technology to drive onboarding efficiency and employee engagement? — Change the way HR serves the business — Rethink and simplify HR processes — Improve the overall user experience to engage employees — Keep pace with technology innovations — Make HCM as agile as the business — Migrate from on-prem solutions to cloud — Address HCM vendor gaps in solution capability and the need for case and knowledge management Customer Conversation: Digitizing the employee experience 1 2   Manage  Transform  AdviseEngage    Solution focus later   Business needs focus  Industry focusConsulting-led sales 5 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch DXC designs, deploys and secures new cloud and platform solutions at scale that can be integrated with a client’s IT estate to produce better business outcomes. As clients undertake cloud adoption and digital transformation, they face challenges in scaling and managing their new solutions while successfully integrating them with their existing IT landscape. DXC helps clients in three ways: • First, we discover and define their IT and regulatory estate, using people, processes and products to deliver a solid referential data layer for GRC and SecOps automation. • Second, we structure digitally their GRC and SecOps landscape by adopting and adapting best practice, pre-built policies, processes, controls, frameworks and runbooks. • Finally, we transform their operational resilience by reducing the scale and velocity of work through an automated, controlled response to threats to stability of any kind, along with a comprehensive MI layer to provide transparency and clarity. We have the experience, vision, innovation and talent to scale client operations globally and accelerate their digital transformation. Digital transformation enabled by providing a secure foundation “Going digital” can be a compelling event. Enterprises performing transformations are the leading factor driving public cloud engagement and adoption today. Regulatory pressures, sprawling IT estates, advances in technology, a world of ever- present challenges to security and stability, and new business models are compelling our clients to become more agile, in a manner that reduces barriers, increases response velocity and provides them with more flexibility in how they respond to systemic threats, changing marketplaces and their customer demands. From a business perspective, clients are focusing on innovation, agility and automation as a means to facilitate faster time to value with no loss of service delivery. Clients must evolve legacy technology systems, processes, applications and thinking to survive. As clients begin to adapt their processes to a digital context, GRC, SecOps and BCM technologies can provide the scale, structure and speed needed to deliver operationally resilient enterprises. Cloud platform services are the foundation for this resilient, agile business world. It’s the platform that enables coherence, while cloud-based services are key to delivering flexible, on-demand access to the resources underpinning new business offerings. GRC, SecOps and BCM platform services allow organizations to define their approach and response to resilience challenges in an efficient and compliant way, bringing financial savings and operational confidence. Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes, not cloud technology. Our conversations must focus on business, organization and financials. We need to validate that clients are making IT investments that align with their business strategy. This narrative shows the potential arc of a business outcome conversation with a client. Organizations look to the public cloud as a way to go digital. Potentially, costs and the required skills to maintain multiple platforms can increase. Organizations need a blend of industry knowledge and platform knowledge to co-create secure digital experiences. DXC is a digital transformation partner. We simplify complex IT support and operations to help clients focus on their core business. DXC has industrialized IT automation built into our platforms. We continue to build on this automated foundation.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve We want to help clients strengthen their ability to deal with internal and external GRC and SecOps threats and challenges and prove their compliance. Leverage our domain and technical expertise as required. • Define a proof of concept, business case and plan • Define the high-level approach: DXC can design, implement and then run, only design and implement or just design or implement or run, in line with business objectives and regulatory mandates • Position on a DXC or customer instance and then manage as a program with clear KPIs that define what success looks like • Produce an organizational reference data layer — departments, locations, assets, services levering the platform. Identify target legislation, policies and controls. Address security, policies, processes, plans, risk and governance. • Use prebuilt content to accelerate time to value for GRC and SecOps; retire or integrate existing tools or platforms to either save or justify expenditure; prove business value using outcomes and KPIs as per business case • Produce a list of linked business assets, vendors, contracts and services with criticality and owners • Research and decide on applicable legislation • Produce an agreed, quantified enterprise risk and enterprise policy framework • Link policies, controls and risks • Produce a vendor risk and vendor performance assessment program • Research and define an organizational security posture, including BCP/DR provisions • Design a security architecture that aligns with the posture and ServiceNow platform • Use the ServiceNow platform to integrate disparate GRC and SecOps technologies and processes • Produce a management information layer that drives business outcomes correctly and coalesces relevant information from all GRC and SecOps What’s the conversation? Most clients lack operational resilience. They are coping with increasing volumes and velocities of regulation and threats, with hybridized estates of legacy and cloud infrastructure. The classic silos of behavior and oversight are all too evident. This brings a slow, fragmented management approach, all of which bring operational fragility. To resolve, a combination of high-quality underlying organizational data along with agreed and coherent policies, processes, workflows in one platform to help bring people together and guide their actions are required. Client problems • Time to manage risk and compliance is excessive — Regulatory complexity/unknown regulatory scope and operational governance are managed using spreadsheets and emails, causing large overheads. • Growing regulatory backlog — Organizations are under growing pressure to change and respond faster to internal and external policy demands. • Vendors are bringing risk to organizations — An increasing propensity to outsource critical processes brings systemic risk in case of vendor failure. • Silo-based approach— Risk, compliance, audit, SecOps, vendor and contract management teams operate in their own silos, bringing a disjointed and slow approach. • Operational burden and complexity — Clients are unable to manage current GRC and SecOps environment efficiently, costs are increasing and there is a mismatch of technical skills. There is also an increasing number of technical problems that take too long to fix. • Security threats are increasing in volume and velocity — Security threats are increasing in their number and the time to exploit weaknesses. Combined with increased fines from regulators for breaches, this can pose existential risks. • Organizations don’t understand the real-world impact of security — Too much guesswork, hope and ignorance is being used to “protect” organizations. There is an inability to locate and retire legacy applications and technologies in case of breaches. • Organizations don’t have relevant expertise — Understanding the domains of regulations and security is extremely time-, resource- and labor-intensive.

Building Operational Security & Resilience 13 DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch In any operation, worker safety is paramount. While many applications exist for reporting incidents, hazards and risks, the cloud-based HSE suite gives everyone in an operation access to the tools and information they need to go beyond reporting and to proactively mitigate potential problems. HSE is packed with features that advance the ability to identify risks and efficiently respond to, investigate and manage incidents when and where they occur. DXC helps clients in two ways: • Organizations looking for a better way to manage health, safety and environmental issues will find rapid time to value without sacrificing, or limiting, potential return on investment and the ability to transform their incident tracking. HSE does this through a global incident view, fostering a safety culture and proactive mitigation prioritization. • Armed with data and information, companies can quickly make a business case for the funding required to ensure a safe working environment. CFOs will not only appreciate the prioritized list of necessary spending required to ensure workers’ well-being but also the cost reduction from improved health, safety and environmental outcomes. Digital transformation enabled by improving business processes through technology Prioritizing spending for hazard mitigation can be tough and time consuming — but not when you have the operation-wide, real-time reporting capabilities of the DXC Health, Safety and Environmental Management Suite (HSE) product. Customize your view, set up automated reporting and analyze data to make well-founded decisions based on complete information. Armed with data and information, you can quickly make a business case for the funding you need to ensure a safe environment. Your CFO will not only appreciate the prioritized list of necessary spending required to ensure your workers’ well-being but also the cost reduction from improved health, safety and environmental outcomes. The enhanced ability to identify root cause issues and apply appropriate mitigation are the key to success in driving production efficiency and improved customer service. In addition, global safety and security regulations now require frequent reporting. Automation of those reporting processes is key to timely submission, better safety protocols and improved reputation on social media. Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes and flexibility. Our conversations must focus on business agility, organization and financials. We need to validate that clients are making IT investments that align with their business strategy. This narrative shows the potential arc of a business outcome conversation with a client. The Health, Safety and Environmental application provides key capabilities that help clients execute a successful digital transformation. Features that improve safety and efficiency Mobility.

Corporate Incident Response 15 DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve DXC’s Health, Safety and Environmental application can be implemented into any ServiceNow environment if the client is an existing ServiceNow customer. The application is downloaded from the store and is typically installed as part of an overall consulting engagement. The product will help solve the following challenges: • Risk mitigation – Provides identification of high-risk areas; actual/potential causes and trends – Real-time data and reporting enables quick and solid analysis for prioritizing investment and spend • Reporting – Holistic solution, including best-in-class, real-time event tracking that fosters a safety culture through better awareness, worker engagement and visibility to data across facilities and regions • Automated compliance reporting – Workmen's Compensation, accident and injury as mandated by most countries and some UN conventions • Stable cash flow – Flexible and scalable cloud-based solution maximizing ROI by reducing unpredictable incident and maintenance costs and by improving employee and workplace health and safety • Root causes and trend analysis – Decision analysis and review capability for incidents and near misses to identify and address training, equipment and design issues in work areas Commercial considerations • Structure as an annual program with measurable business case objectives. • Client funds core simplify/optimize engagement, pays for individual projects and receives benefit from each project. • Where DXC assumes financial risk, gain share model may be appropriate. • The target annual savings should be in the range of 10%-20% of a client’s overall IT budget. • For smaller accounts, a programmatic approach may not be justified — need to proceed commercially, project by project. What’s the conversation? At DXC we recognize that safe, environmentally responsible operations not only save lives and reduce cost but add organizational value by providing a foundation for identifying new business opportunities and enhancing existing operations through consistent process documentation and risk mitigation. In addition, reporting, risk of civil penalties, potential fines and public opinion are always existential threats to not only profitability but potentially the existence of the organization. Community awareness and messaging are critical aspects of any modern enterprise. Whether your organization uses social media or not, it has a strong impact on your customers and competitors. Unplanned environmental or safety events can have an immediate, negative impact on the organization's bottom line if not managed proactively. The first step in successful social media message control is access to timely, coordinated and accurate incident information, quickly presented to media experts to help them mitigate damage and craft a story beneficial to the organization. DXC’s cloud-based health and safety tool is the best option for minimizing the innate risks of company operations. It provides deep insights into organizational strengths and weaknesses and allows leadership to quickly identify root-cause issues that can then be treated to optimize success. Client problems DXC’s HSE application provides a unified view of the challenges and risks associated with business operations. This central repository allows for prompt and effective changes to processes to prevent accident, injury and environmental hazard. Many companies today face similar struggles with their operational health and safety programs, often with the following common problems: • Incident tracking on multiple spreadsheets; no operation-wide view of incidents, risks and hazards – Lack of centralized reporting allows the “big picture” to be lost • Lack of real-time reporting, data not centralized; legacy solutions on premise – Legacy solutions on site can fail and delay reporting and process improvement • Root-cause analysis cannot be easily assessed – All successful safety programs rely on root cause analysis for process and procedural change • Compliance audits can require a large effort and become disruptive • Difficulty recognizing negative trends or warning signs Customer Conversation: Corporate incident response 1 2 15 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve We want to help clients remove IT complexity and waste so they can refocus their resources on accelerating value-based business outcomes. Target complexity and inefficiencies at the source. Address security, policies and governance. Identify target services to assess, define a proof of concept, business case and plan and then manage as a program with clear KPIs that define what success looks like. Clients should consider a low-code application development platform when aiming to replatform their legacy application estates and making application development decisions. Example levers to simplify and optimize: • Rationalize redundant and underutilized applications • Optimize IT governance and controls for greater simplicity • Take control of the application life cycle • Continuously optimize developer resources to demand • Implement low-code application development platform technology • Optimize workload placement (on premises or on public cloud) • Eliminate legacy technologies and outdated applications • Look to refresh software to modern technology application development platforms and architectures Commercial considerations • Structure as an annual program with measurable business case objectives. • Client funds core simplify/optimize engagement, pays for individual projects and receives benefit from each project. • Where DXC assumes financial risk, gain share model may be appropriate. • The target annual savings should be in the range of 10%-20% of a client’s overall IT budget. • For smaller accounts, a programmatic approach may not be justified — need to proceed commercially, project by project. What’s the conversation? As clients industrialize and prepare to use an application development platform, this can prevent them from focusing on their strategic agenda. They are coping with legacy technologies, applications and IT estates that are becoming more difficult to manage and are therefore dealing with increased operational expenses and the need for stronger governance. The existing burden of legacy applications build using legacy high-code development technologies is holding them back, and it’s hard to find skilled development resources and keep up with the current demand for change of the business. If not proactively addressed, it drives up costs, reduces quality and slows the pace of change and time to market. Clients want to reduce their legacy technology dependencies and increase their agility and ability to change and serve the business/customer better and faster. Clients aim to simplify and optimize their IT by rationalizing, standardizing application development while addressing maintainability and sustainability at the same time. Client problems • Time to execute change is too long — System complexity and technical debt often drive this reality. An enterprise IT organization is often perceived as unable to respond to the LOB requests fast enough or that IT is struggling to meet the LOB demands. • End of service life — Clients don’t keep up with tech refresh cycles, incurring large maintenance and development costs. • Technical debt — Outdated infrastructure and applications, sweating of applications (technical debt) and continuing to chase obsolescence. • Growing backlog — Organizations are under a growing pressure to change and respond faster to customer and LOB demand. • Operational burden and complexity — Inability to manage current application development environment efficiently, costs increasing, mismatch of technical skills and increasing number of technical problems that take too long to fix. • No time to innovate — Often the budget is consumed by legacy development, scarce and costly resources and keep-the-lights-on, which represents 70 — 80% of the spend. • Change is the only constant — Costs are too high, and clients are unable to divert resources to new innovation; inability to locate and retire legacy applications and technologies.

Let me help you fix this to prove the value of DXC. Framing questions What steps have you already taken to improve alignment with business needs? What capabilities do you need to improve your organization’s alignment with business needs? Diagnostic questions Usage scenario How big is your project backlog? Does the backlog solely comprise changes to existing apps or also brand-new apps? What types of projects are getting higher priority from the business? Would you say your team is behind in terms of delivery timelines? When addressing the business app backlog could delivery times be reduced if your teams could build and change apps in weeks vs. months (using a visual approach)? Has the business ever come to you with their own prototype/ experimental app? Are your teams proposing business innovation through exploratory projects? How often does your team deliver a prototype for the business to validate and evaluate a new idea? What is the average turnaround time for your team to deliver a working prototype? While experimenting with new business ideas could they be realized faster if your teams created working prototypes that can directly evolve to live applications? Describe your current feedback loop or mechanism between the business end users and development teams. Do your business stakeholders feel like they are not being understood by your development teams? Do your development teams find the business requirements and change requests to be lacking detail? How much time and resources are wasted on rework due to miscommunication? When collaborating with the business could the feedback loop be improved with IT if the business users provided contextual feedback directly in the app? How does your organization adopt new development technologies? What is your strategy to overcome your organization's natural resistance to change? What changes to your team do you think are needed to successfully adopt a faster way of delivering? How will you prepare the business to keep up with your team's new delivery speed? When aligning with the business could time to value be decreased if your team and the business used playbooks that laid out best practices to accelerate app delivery and adoption?

Customer Conversation: Objection handling and discovery Q&A 1 2 Discovery Q&A (cont'd) Framing questions Was your DT goal set by yourself, the CEO, board of directors, lines of business? What capabilities do you need to implement your DT strategy? Diagnostic questions Usage scenario Do you think your current tools and methodologies are optimal to implement your DT strategy? What changes to your team do you think are needed to successfully adopt a faster way of delivering? How does your organization adopt new development technologies? What is your strategy to overcome your organization's natural resistance to change? How will you prepare the business to keep up with your team's new delivery speed? When implementing a DT strategy with the business, could planning time be reduced and chances of a quick success be increased if your team and the business used playbooks that laid out best practices to accelerate app delivery and adoption? Is customer engagement part of your DT strategy? How are you keeping up with UI/UX expectations of your clients? Are you able to provide a consistent experience across all channels and apps? Do you have a reusable UX plan or guidelines for all new initiatives or is this done fresh for each new project? When creating new apps, could the execution of your DT strategy be improved if your team could deliver apps in a fraction of the time without compromising branding and UX? What percent of the current business requests are mobile apps versus web apps (or possibly both)? How does mobility fit into your DT strategy? Is your business increasingly asking for more advanced mobile features, offline mobile apps, use of native device features? How are you addressing the increasing pressure to accommodate BYOD (bring your own device) from your business? Are you prepared for that many platforms? When faced with business requests that have multiple delivery channels, could these projects be delivered in less time if the same resource could build web and mobile apps simultaneously? Are you a Forrester client? Have you seen the latest analyst (Forrester) reports and evaluations on ___? How many new technologies do you think you will adopt as part of your DT? Are you using any outside DT advisors or consultants? Would you feel more secure knowing you were partnering with the pioneer of the low code? When setting out on your DT journey, could risk be reduced if your organization partnered with the proven industry-leading solution for creating apps to support your DT? 21 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

As clients accelerate their digital transformation journey, IT has a strategic role to transform the way employees consume enterprise services, including IT, HR, finance, procurement, facility, legal and marketing. Coming from a fragmented service delivery approach, our clients need to streamline design, build, test and run activities (production) while structuring new product or services innovation roadmap and better managing business relationship and customer satisfaction. DXC ServiceNow Center of Excellence brings certainty on quality of delivery through SLAs and KPIs aligned with expected business outcomes. DXC Center of Excellence is built on three pillars: • Innovation: We bring value with structured product strategy and roadmap while reinforcing design authority through a co-delivery partnership with ServiceNow. • Production: We streamline costs and quality of ServiceNow platform delivery with industrial Design, Build, Test and Run delivery activities and associated SLAs. • Transformation: We streamline management of change activities, including training, communication and industrial deployment while changing the game, building strong business relationships. Center of Excellence as a lever to transform ServiceNow platform to enterprise service management In many companies, business and IT go their separate ways once the implementation of the ServiceNow project is complete. To get enduring results, the business must drive the ongoing improvements needed for the ServiceNow platform to become a true enterprise service management platform. It is the business — supported by IT — that needs to identify the process changes, reporting for decision-making and end-user needs on an ongoing basis. The ServiceNow Center of Excellence requires a mix of process owners within the business community, business relationship manager, functional application experts, architects and technical experts. In addition, the delivery team needs leaders to drive innovation and develop ServiceNow platform outreach within the business. Overall, the ServiceNow Center of Excellence is a fantastic opportunity for IT to better align with business needs and fuel enterprise service management innovation across the organization, helping break silos between IT and non-IT organizations (HR, finance, procurement, facility, etc.). Our narrative Clients want to focus on the business value the ServiceNow platform can bring to the organization. Our conversations must focus on industrialization, innovation and cost reduction and build intimacy with the business. The employee experience is at the center of today’s enterprise. Whether it’s process, technology, infrastructure or innovation, lines of business from IT to HR and beyond are addressing issues by putting the employee and customer experience first. We designed the ServiceNow Center of Excellence to break down the walls between IT and the business and provide sustainable support and innovation that remains business focused.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve With the Center of Excellence we help clients industrialize ServiceNow platform delivery from innovation through transformation of IT and non-IT enterprise services. The Center of Excellence enables fast-paced reactive and proactive responses to business needs. The Center of Excellence provides business and application expertise to support an organization's global or domestic ServiceNow implementation by designing new processes, optimizing current ones, managing complex implementation projects, providing user support and training, and keeping the ServiceNow system landscape up and running 24/7. In addition, the Center of Excellence helps optimize the use of all ServiceNow products implemented in a cost-effective manner, contributing to the overall company's success. Some of the key functions and benefits of the COE: • A standard vehicle for deploying ServiceNow best practices • A central point of contact for all ServiceNow-related matters • Development of strong competencies in all ServiceNow areas • Enhances the value of the ServiceNow solution; more standardization and better integration • Improvements in user productivity and employee experience • Reduced cost of ServiceNow operations (TCO) • Improved retention of key ServiceNow personnel • Improved service levels Commercial considerations • The CoE offering covers end-to-end ServiceNow platform life cycle management, structuring multi-million dollar and multi-year contract. • DXC could provide a pay-as-you-go pricing model for CoE, allowing clients to pay according to the actual volume of services consumed. • Adopt programmatic approach and proactive joint proposal with ServiceNow where DXC/ServiceNow has developed business value framework. • Consider win back for accounts where DXC was close to win. What’s the conversation? Clients have been struggling to deliver on time, on quality and on budget the ServiceNow platform projects and run, whether to transform IT or non-IT organization, processes and tools. They want to deliver faster and improve the customer experience while reducing costs and risks. They need to accelerate value delivered to the business through better quality management and de-risk project delivery go-live commitments while controlling budgets. As organizations mature, the focus shifts from tactical only to the strategic thoughts of “what business value can we bring with the enterprise service management platform.” The framework should include everything from strategic planning and roadmap to tactical execution. Both are important to measure value delivered to the business. Without a plan in place to scale the platform as the company grows, it can be difficult to demonstrate its value. If a client is struggling to manage its ServiceNow platform while seeking investor or committee support, it is crucial to ramp up and rationalize platform governance. Proper governance of the ServiceNow program will help steer the program as follows : • Understand business demand and strategic business outcomes to define platform strategy • Business demand prioritization against value delivered will shape platform roadmap • Established standards drive execution in delivery of service and continuous service improvement (CSI) • Business KPIs will steer ServiceNow Center of Excellence while constantly measuring value delivered to the business and customer satisfaction Client problems • Skills: Finding the right skills and talents in a stretched market where good resources are missing • Governance: Governing and steering ServiceNow projects with heterogeneous project management discipline to meet timeframe, quality and budget • Accountability: Multiple service providers on projects dilute accountability and make projects difficult to steer properly while putting additional workload and accountability on clients to manage this complexity and lack of drive • Visibility: Lack or limited visibility on new product/service roadmap to be able to structure delivery teams proactively • Proactivity: No or limited business relationship management governance to manage innovation roadmap and expectations with the business, and structure demand pipeline to plan delivery requirements • Benefits: Poor budget actuals creating pressure to reduce ambition on new services opportunities Customer Conversation: Service Management Center of Excellence 1 2 24DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch Organizations are transforming their IT department to enable their digital journey of delivering faster and improved customer experience while reducing costs and risks. This transformation creates a fundamentally different IT ecosystem (e.g., multi-vendor cloud) with a new way of working such as agile and DevOps. Organizations need to realize they need to rethink the way they manage their IT ecosystem and take a more holistic approach to IT management across the entire IT value chain. DXC helps clients in three ways: • We simplify and optimize the IT value chain, using automation and continuous optimization, to deliver savings that fund digital initiatives. • Second, we modernize the existing IT management tool chain (e.g., introduce new way of working such as DevOps and multi-cloud management). • Finally, we transform the IT function to enable the clients’ business agenda through a secure, platform-centric digital management foundation. Our dedicated Management of Change team supports the change from a people perspective, assuring awareness and smooth adoption of the change. We have the experience, vision, innovation and talent to scale client operations globally and accelerate their digital transformation. Digital transformation of IT management with the IT4IT standard Market pressures, advances in technology and new business models are compelling our clients to become more agile in a manner that reduces barriers and provides them with more flexibility in how they respond to the changing marketplace and their customer demand. From a business perspective, clients are focusing on innovation, agility and automation as a means to facilitate faster time to value. To enable these digital challenges a new digital management capability is needed to create a more integrated and value stream approach to plan, build, deploy and manage digital offerings. This new digital management ecosystem is characterized by: • More components (e.g. IOT, cloud, APIs) • More vendors • More changes (due to continuous delivery) • More compliance policies (e.g. GDPR) • More security events • Monitor IT data e.g. monitoring and log data Most organizations now realize they need to transform their IT organization to manage this new digital reality covering DevOps, agile development, self-service and automating IT activities. Digitalization of IT management using the IT4IT standard from The Open Group is becoming a prerequisite for enabling digital transformation. Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes and agility. Our conversations must focus on business agility, organization and financials. We need to validate that clients are making IT investments that align with their business strategy. This narrative shows the potential arc of a business outcome conversation with a client. IT organizations have to manage complex IT systems, processes and data under business pressures to reduce costs, increase speed and bring innovation. We help IT organizations manage the new digital ecosystem with an increasing number of vendors, technologies, etc. The IT4IT standard is the end-to-end integrated digital framework needed to transform the IT function to be more cost efficient and deliver faster with lower risk. DXC has all the experience and skills to build an integrated IT management capability. We simplify IT management to help clients focus on their core business.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow What’s the conversation? The complicated and extensive IT landscapes in modern enterprises are critical to business success but are increasingly challenging to manage. As many organizations transform their way of working, (e.g., introduce agile development, DevOps and move applications to the cloud) they also need to define a new vision and strategy for their IT management ecosystem (organization, processes and IT management tool landscape). IT management systems, processes and data that are not aligned to a single integrated framework introduce unnecessary costs, unacceptable risks and avoidable delays, all which impact business competitiveness. Clients want to deliver faster and improve customer experience while reducing costs and risks. More and more organizations realize they need to create a modern IT management capability — rationalizing, standardizing and automating their IT management tool chain. IT4IT is an IT industry standard for managing “the business of IT” that provides a digital framework with which to consolidate systems to reduce costs, create a single version of common data to reduce risks and integrate processes to accelerate IT delivery to the business. Client problems • Complexity — Complex IT management tooling landscape with fragmented tools, processes and data; creating an integrated DevOps pipeline is complex; many initiatives to improve the IT function • Data — A lot of IT data but lacking transparency and traceability; no real-time insight into costs, risk, customer experience and performance; no insight for continuous improvement • Manual activities — IT organizations still have too many manual activities • Value — Inability to demonstrate value of IT services for the business Customer Conversation: Run IT as a business 1 2 DXC’s point of view on how to solve We help our clients streamline and automate IT processes across the entire IT value chain from “idea” to “production” by creating a modern IT operating model based upon the IT4IT standard. Optimizing IT management starts with a business case. DXC has world-leading experts, unique tools (assessments, simulations, references) and the experience needed to build a thorough and viable investment case, a target blueprint and a transformation roadmap. Based on that roadmap the transformation can be phased with the highest impact aspects going earlier to provide the savings and benefits to support the later phases. The implementation sequence is always tailored to the specific starting point and objectives of the client. Example levers to optimize • Define an IT management vision and strategy • Define an IT management architecture (based on the IT4IT standard) • Simplify and consolidate complex, fragmented and costly IT management landscape • Modernize the current IT management landscape to be suitable for the new way of working (deliver in the cloud, continuous deployment, manage security risks, etc.) • Improve the quality of IT management data, e.g., make CMDB up to date, license management, service portfolio, etc. • Automate more IT management activities to eliminate many manual IT management activities • Gain cost insight; allocate costs based on actual consumption • Implement integrated services/application portfolio and self-service catalog (self service/self help); focus on people using management of change practices • Move from reactive to proactive monitoring and automate event response • Consolidate the many fragmented initiatives to improve the IT function 29 DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Set up IT4IT architectural involvement (with a DXC IT4IT architect at the client’s enterprise architecture department). All-at-once adoption and implementation of IT4IT for an enterprise is a high-cost, high-risk decision, so pitch in the following way: 1. Think big — adopt the IT4IT framework as your IT management standard and use the IT4IT assessment to create a target blueprint and roadmap for the ideal end state 2. Start small — choose the highest-impact (cost, risk, value) component of the framework to start with and use that success to drive support for the next component 3. Act fast — a complicated multi-year roadmap must deliver substantial near-term benefits to be viable  The target annual savings of the IT4IT program is in the range of 10% of a client’s overall IT budget. Offer “IT management as a service” to the client to reduce entry cost for the client, gain “instant” digitalization and get to IT standards more quickly. DXC FP takes accountability for desimplementing, operating and supporting the transformed IT management solution for the client on a subscription basis, leaving the client more able to focus more on IT that improves business revenue, profitability and market share. Look to offset the client-perceived risk of buying into a multi-year IT management transformation program based on IT4IT with annual checkpoints on ROI and value, which then justifies continuing if a managed service or strategic program approach is not achievable (e.g., due to governance issues); proceed on a project-by-project basis to build up client confidence. 30DXC Proprietary and Confidential.

Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Objection handling “We already do all of this stuff ourselves”: Doing each of the aspects of IT management well is a good start but unless they are all based on a unifying blueprint, IT management cannot be consolidated, integrated and automated to optimize efficiency, effectiveness and quality of the end-to-end outcomes. DXC has the expertise, experience and capability to drive that next level of optimization for your IT function. “This is too big, too risky and too disruptive for us to buy into”: Adopting the IT4IT framework is low cost and low risk. From there we can assess for a specific customer where the largest gains can be delivered fastest and develop a roadmap that fits with the investment objectives, appetite for risk and maturity of the client. That way we can gain lower-risk early wins to validate the approach and in some cases provide funding for the next phases. All phases will deliver benefits individually but more importantly amplify the collective benefits from all phases, because they are all part of the same integrated IT4IT framework. “We don’t want locked into a proprietary multi-year roadmap with a specific supplier”: IT4IT is an IT industry standard independently managed by the Open Group. Everything we do will be aligned to the standard, making it easily transferable to internal IT or another partner if that becomes necessary. “We are a global enterprise with many business units, and we can’t manage the internal change to transform our IT management”: Reorienting the IT function and end users to accept a new way of working is a real challenge. DXC FP can draw upon extensive experience in management of change to support the transition. “We’ve already adopted ITIL and the other standards, why do we need another one?”: IT4IT is the unifying framework that combines, aligns and integrates other IT standards. IT4IT pulls these other standards into a full end-to-end framework across the complete IT life cycle and for all IT activities. IT4IT defines the common data model that should be used for the whole IT life cycle and goes down to the level of detail required to actually implement the standard. Customer Conversation: Discovery, overcoming objections and key messages 1 2 Discovery Q&A Q. Do you have a complete picture of your current IT management people, processes, tools, data, integrations and controls and how much all of that costs to operate? A. Typically IT management landscapes grow up organically over time with a number of best-of-breed systems with overlapping functionality exchanging and converting data over complex and fragile customized interfaces. Using IT4IT as the reference standard it is possible to simplify, consolidate and optimize all of these aspects to save money and improve outcomes. Q. Do you have a vision and strategy for your target IT management blueprint in terms of your transition to DevOps, agile development, CI/CD and cloud? A. Using IT4IT as the reference standard it is possible to systematically understand, simplify, consolidate and optimize all aspects of your IT management activities to save money and improve IT and business outcomes. Q. Can you see in real time how your IT activities are performing across internal IT teams and external suppliers and pinpoint where you need to take action to remediate issues? A. IT4IT connects all the IT management systems, processes, data and teams together in an integrated end-to-end framework. This allows IT leaders to see what the IT function is doing minute by minute across end-to-end activities between multiple suppliers and take action. Q. Is it a challenge to achieve and maintain consensus between IT and business stakeholders and teams on the challenges, objectives and opportunities for the IT function and to effectively prioritize the most valuable initiatives? A. The IT4IT standard provides an industry best-practice target state for organizations to head toward, and the end- to-end view it provides allows IT investment decisions to be taken in the context of the project, demand and operational support consequences that will result. Q. Can you be confident that your IT management practices will pass security and compliance controls audits? A. Typically it is very difficult to self-assess compliance and assurance readiness ahead of formal audits. Using IT4IT to define how data is structured, stored and modified and an integrated workflow system like ServiceNow to control and automate access to that data, the risk of non-compliance is greatly reduced and capabilities such as continuous controls compliance through rules-based automation can take a more proactive stance toward controls compliance. Q. Is your IT organization spending a lot more time, budget and effort on managing IT rather than creating value with the business? A. Typical IT operations organizations focus up to 80% of their efforts on non-differentiating IT management activities (IT incidents, changes and requests) and much less on differentiating IT activities (data analytics, financial risk, supply chain automation, etc.) that directly improve business bottom line and market share. By adopting the IT4IT and automating standard workflows all using the same shared data, the burden of managing IT can be greatly reduced (or eliminated by outsourcing), allowing the IT function to focus on partnering with the business to innovate and create new value. 31 DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Run IT as a Business 32DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Digital transformation enabled by providing a secure foundation “Going digital” can be a compelling event. Enterprises conducting transformations are the leading factor driving public cloud engagement and adoption today. Regulatory pressures, sprawling IT estates, advances in technology, a world of ever- present challenges to security and stability, and new business models are compelling our clients to become more agile, in a manner that reduces barriers, increases response velocity and provides them with more flexibility in how they respond to systemic threats, changing marketplaces and their customer demands. From a business perspective, clients are focusing on innovation, agility and automation as a means to facilitate faster time to value without a negative impact on service delivery. Our narrative Clients want to focus on business outcomes and agility. Our conversations must focus on the underlying orchestration and operational governance processes and components that make all this possible in a manner that optimally balances the sometimes conflicting requirements of agility (velocity and flexibility) and governance. DXC has world-leading capabilities in ServiceNow design and implementation. Additionally, we have extensive experience in architecting, engineering and operating enterprise-grade IT infrastructures in highly regulated, business-critical environments. We combine these expertise areas to help clients safely embrace the benefits of cloud. In short, we help clients deliver and use cloud services with the following characteristics: • Agility without anarchy • Governance without bureaucracy Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Elevator pitch As clients undertake cloud adoption as part of digital transformation, they face challenges in scaling, governing and managing their new solutions and recognize the need to successfully integrate them with existing IT operational tools and processes. In essence, the challenge is to deliver the flexibility, economics and faster time-to-market of cloud, without compromising on operational and commercial integrity. Existing or prospective ServiceNow customers can realize further value from their investment by implementing the ServiceNow Cloud Management Platform (CMP) product. This helps drive adoption of cloud services in an optimized way, ensuring that benefits are realized and risks are mitigated. ServiceNow CMP delivers agility across clouds with automated governance, integration with existing ITSM processes to ensure operational risks are managed consistently, and visibility is provided to optimize cloud spend and assure compliance with policies and standards. 33DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow Who you sell to — what they care about and what to talk about Digital selling tips Digital selling is different — It’s about client intimacy and engagement. Create a dialogue around the client's business agenda, the business value we can drive, and digital transformation beyond just the IT systems. Do your homework — You must understand the client and their industry before you speak with the client. Keep an eye out for compelling events. Probe with open-ended questions to identify where the client is on their journey. Engage the client — Not only the IT buyer, engage the wider business. Digital is about bringing IT and business desires into a state of reality. Seek to understand the client's digital journey and figure out DXC's relevance in that journey. Focus on stated ambitions and help clients develop a POV on how to best enable their objectives.  Doing is the new selling — Use a deep, consultative approach with clients that is business-driven. Talk about creating points of value through proofs of concept as a “try and then buy” approach. Create the solution clients want in a minimally viable way so they can touch the solution. 33DXC Proprietary and Confidential. C EO Our IT systems aren’t delivering the competitive edge we need.

PROBLEM SOLUTION VALUE Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow 34DXC Proprietary and Confidential. Digitizing the Employee Experience Building Operational Security & Resilience Corporate Incident Response Business Process Automation Service Management Center of Excellence Run IT as a Business Operationalize the Cloud with ServiceNow DXC’s point of view on how to solve We want to help clients build on an existing or planned investment in ServiceNow and gain further value from that investment by implementing the ServiceNow Cloud Management Platform (CMP). ServiceNow CMP delivers agility across clouds with automated governance, integration with existing ITSM processes to ensure operational risks are managed consistently, and visibility is provided to optimize cloud spend and assure compliance with policies and standards. Integrating with all major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP and VMware), CMP brings the capability to integrate and operationalize any client cloud investment. Examples to define, change and manage: • Discuss and understand clients' existing cloud strategy and ServiceNow plans. • Examine current plans and pain points in cloud adoption and application migration. • Plan an approach to use ServiceNow CMP to address current and future needs in cloud management. • Consult on definition of an operating model that clarifies responsibilities for IT service and security operations teams with ServiceNow CMP configuration and the native cloud platform teams. • Understand corporate policies and standards needed for automation to support CMP delivery. • Identify priority compliance and financial control reporting needs. Commercial considerations • Structure as a phased program with measurable business case objectives. • Ensure baselines measured to determine ROI — agility, cost, compliance • Client funds and receives benefit from each phase of the project. • Where DXC assumes financial risk, gain-share model may be appropriate. • The target is to substantially reduce the workload for staff and customers as well. • Link work to existing ServiceNow or cloud programs to leverage investment and improve ROI. What’s the conversation? As clients undertake cloud adoption as part of digital transformation, they face challenges in scaling, governing and managing their new solutions and recognize the need to successfully integrate them with existing IT operational tools and processes. IT CIOs are demanding the agility benefit of cloud while the organization still demands strict adherence to corporate policies and standards and needs to be assured that service quality and financial controls remain intact. In essence, the challenge is to deliver the flexibility, economics and faste time-to-market of cloud, without compromising on operational and commercial integrity. Client problems • Time to deliver new IT services is too long — Legacy technical, commercial and operational controls lead to excessive delivery times for new services. Silo-based delivery approach not working. • Moving to fully scaled production services in the Cloud — Clients are moving from experimentation with cloud services and need to move to operate cloud at scale alongside legacy environments. • Achieving the benefits of Cloud — Clients are failing to deliver the benefits of application migration. Adoption is still below aspirations, and net benefits are not being achieved at the pace required. • Risk and compliance management in the cloud — Regulatory complexity/unknown regulatory scope and operational governance are typically managed manually using spreadsheets and emails, causing large overheads and further reducing cloud benefits. • Building new skills and capability — Clients are looking to new ways of working with cloud through DevOps operating models and agile methodologies.

This allows customers to better understand, predict and optimize the performance of each unique product. This digital representation can be done for an individual asset, an integrated system of assets or a fleet of assets. Un-enabled Vision. The industry does better than others to discern a digital vision and to make the investment, but lags behind in the digital enablement in data & analytics, talent or infrastructure that maximize the return on the investment. CUSTOMER INSIGHTS Employee accessibility. A&D are more susceptible to dealing with a mix of paper and electronic work instructions. These customers are looking for novel ways to communicate and streamline work processes with employees (e.g. interactive diagrams on mobile devices). High sustainment costs. Sustainment cost of maintaining newer equipment is substantially higher than in the past. Improved predictive maintenance programs leveraging the vast amount of new data is seen as a solution. High risk data. Awareness of the Cloud/cyber activity issues, solutions that can enhance security can stand apart from other options. A&D may not be as quick as other industries, but they have a complexity rate that is increasing. Disrupting field operations. Technology such as 3D printing makes it possible for deployed ships to manufacture more replacement parts while at sea, reducing downtime. 4 DXC A&D vision November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Shutterstock.com image ID: 1014773851 – HMS Queen Elizabeth at dock at Portsmouth 5  A&D’s new digital value chain Exploiting Digital Technologies Meeting New Demands Coordinated design to build process Reduced time to produce Predictive demand sensing Reduce time to deliver Reduce time to deliver Supply Chain Integration Predictive Maintenance New value-added products /services Generative Design Virtualization and Simulation (AR/VR) Industry 4.0 Vertical Integration 3D printing prototype High Performance Computing Master Scheduling Analytics IoT Predictive Production planning Digital maintenance Real-time product date Real-time product data Drone Inspection MI and AI Maintenance  November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential  Command & Control of Yesterday’s Value Chain Was Effectively Manual & Slow To Generate Outcomes Command & Control of Today’s Value Chain is Digitally-Wired To Generate Outcomes With Precision & Speed  DESIGN MANUFACTURE SERVICE  A&D’s new digital value chain  November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential  Stages of the A&D digital value chain Smart Factory is a focal point in the value chain  Smart Factory allows companies to reduce costs, profitably launch new programs, improve efficiency, streamline processes, and ensure timely throughput and delivery.

The industry lags behind in the digital enablement to enable its vision. INDUSTRY TRENDS CUSTOMER INSIGHTS  November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential INDUSTRY TRENDS Streamlined processes. Transition from linear, document-centric processes to dynamic, digitally-connected processes that maximize the advantages of a digital ecosystem. Supply chain optimization and readiness. Whether they make engines or aircrafts, they all have big order books, they just can’t get their stuff out of the door fast enough. Keeping equipment maintained well beforehand so it is \"ready\" when needed. Production modeling. Engineering in a digital environment through modeling and simulation. This allows customers to better understand, predict and optimize the performance of each unique product. This digital representation can be done for an individual asset, an integrated system of assets or a fleet of assets. Un-enabled Vision. The industry does better than others to discern a digital vision and to make the investment, but lags behind in the digital enablement in data & analytics, talent or infrastructure that maximize the return on the investment. CUSTOMER INSIGHTS Employee accessibility. A&D are more susceptible to dealing with a mix of paper and electronic work instructions. These customers are looking for novel ways to communicate and streamline work processes with employees (e.g. interactive diagrams on mobile devices). High sustainment costs. Sustainment cost of maintaining newer equipment is substantially higher than in the past. Improved predictive maintenance programs leveraging the vast amount of new data is seen as a solution. High risk data. Awareness of the Cloud/cyber activity issues, solutions that can enhance security can stand apart from other options. A&D may not be as quick as other industries, but they have a complexity rate that is increasing. Disrupting field operations. Technology such as 3D printing makes it possible for deployed ships to manufacture more replacement parts while at sea, reducing downtime. 4 DXC A&D vision November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Shutterstock.com image ID: 1014773851 – HMS Queen Elizabeth at dock at Portsmouth 5  A&D’s new digital value chain Exploiting Digital Technologies Meeting New Demands Coordinated design to build process Reduced time to produce Predictive demand sensing Reduce time to deliver Reduce time to deliver Supply Chain Integration Predictive Maintenance New value-added products /services Generative Design Virtualization and Simulation (AR/VR) Industry 4.0 Vertical Integration 3D printing prototype High Performance Computing Master Scheduling Analytics IoT Predictive Production planning Digital maintenance Real-time product date Real-time product data Drone Inspection MI and AI Maintenance  November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential  Command & Control of Yesterday’s Value Chain Was Effectively Manual & Slow To Generate Outcomes Command & Control of Today’s Value Chain is Digitally-Wired To Generate Outcomes With Precision & Speed  DESIGN MANUFACTURE SERVICE  A&D’s new digital value chain  November 13, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential  Stages of the A&D digital value chain Smart Factory is a focal point in the value chain  Smart Factory allows companies to reduce costs, profitably launch new programs, improve efficiency, streamline processes, and ensure timely throughput and delivery.

          "page_body": "  White Paper Helping financial institutions choose a startup and reach their goals Find the right fintech partner White Paper 2 Find the right fintech partner Financial services institutions are experiencing a wave of innovation like never before. Regulatory requirements, ever-increasing customer expectations and fierce competition from new entrants are narrowing margins and pushing institutions involved in capital markets to look for new ways to transform their operations and reach maximum efficiency. Concurrently, emerging technologies are maturing enough to be used for large-scale, enterprise-grade applications. In this rapidly changing environment, an increasing number of fintech startups have decided to collaborate with financial institutions. Fintech startups — with their fresh look at the industry and capacity to innovate without some of the restrictions burdening big companies — are proposing new ways to operate and interact with customers. They are partnering with financial institutions to offer solutions that generate new sources of revenue, reduce costs and digitize, optimize and automate processes. With an ever-increasing number of innovative fintechs in the capital markets landscape, however, it is becoming more difficult for financial organizations to assess which solutions best suit their needs. This paper details the comprehensive study and methodology behind a new DXC Technology consulting service that uses innovative, in-depth analysis to help you untangle the world of fintechs and identify the most appropriate ones for your business activities. Right out of the gate, fintech startups have an advantage over legacy systems distributors and affirmed vendors: They have no legacy and/or cumbersome infrastructures. They can offer a brand-new and more efficient way of handling data and processes. They are not bound by bureaucracy and are therefore able to propose highly innovative solutions in revenue-generating functional areas such as new digital asset markets. DXC’s study focuses on a limited sample of 70 startups that meet three criteria: 1) innovative solutions, 2) less than 10 years in business and 3) specialization in the capital markets industry. Our approach is designed to help financial organizations determine which solutions are right for them, without getting bogged down in excessive evaluation. Our startup study does not cover the entire scope of capital markets — for instance, it omits listed securities trading, which is already mature in terms of revenue generation, cost efficiency and digitization. However, since fintech startups are highly dependent on funding from market participants, they can be considered indicators of the direction the entire capital markets industry is headed. Our study first establishes a forward-looking capital markets functional landscape determined through the analysis of today’s fintech startup ecosystem. A bottom-up approach focuses on the fundamentals underpinning startups for a clear view of which functional areas of the value chain innovative fintech companies pay the most attention to. This approach ensures that we are not biased toward current offerings Table of contents What is driving change? 3 A forward-looking functional landscape highlights two trends 4 A relative-strength fintech map lets the data tell the story 7 Innovative analysis can help financial institutions reach their goals 10 White Paper 3 in today’s capital markets and will not inadvertently reproduce a similar landscape. Disruptive digital technologies are revolutionizing how businesses should be run, and we believe that a top-down approach would lack the accuracy needed to assess and compare startups. We then use a statistical approach to transform the representation of a complex multidimensional startup ecosystem into a relative strength fintech map that plots the startups according to two easily understandable dimensions: disruption potential and life cycle. What is driving change? Three main factors are driving mutations in the capital markets industry: new sources of revenue; cost reduction; and digitization, optimization and automation. New sources of revenue New competition is forcing companies to seek new sources of revenue. The forex (FX) transaction market, for instance, was historically the exclusive prerogative of big financial institutions able to apply hefty margins on non-institutional clients. Today new entrants, such as Revolut and Kantox, offer services ranging from cheaper FX transactions to international transfers, and this has put considerable pressure on big banks to reduce markups. From another standpoint, the 2008 financial crisis prompted regulations to stabilize markets and protect clients. New layers of bureaucracy are redefining the relationship between institutions and clients and pushing financial firms to move away from traditional business models. It is now clearly in the interest of financial companies to explore new services and products and innovative ways of delivering their core businesses. Recently, for example, there has been a move toward developing cryptocurrency exchanges and digital currencies. Cost reduction As data predominates in the digital era, data management becomes a strategic priority for financial institutions. Yet over time, their legacy IT infrastructure has become a fragmented network of systems built for different purposes and stacked in successive layers — an infrastructure that can no longer deal with a more complex and demanding digital environment. A variety of options are now available to help companies manage, store, clean, analyze and report data. These choices include 1) developing solutions internally or with external providers and 2) overhauling or improving the existing infrastructure. Since 2008, new regulations — including EMIR, MiFID II, FATCA, SFTR, MMSR and Basel — have weighed heavily on the financial industry’s balance sheets. Compliance costs have put pressure on businesses to keep up with mandatory regulation changes. Numerous fines — including an $8.9 billion U.S. fine on BNP Paribas for breaching the Iran embargo — have forced companies to add provisions for their liabilities.  White Paper 4 Digitization, optimization and automation As clients demand more flexibility and access to services through mobile devices and other channels, major banks and asset managers are considering the innovation path of digitization, optimization and automation. Various players in the capital markets industry are already investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for pre-trade and execution activities as well as in robotic process automation (RPA) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) — the technology supporting blockchain — for post-trade activities. This trend toward innovation, however, is not widespread across the industry, nor necessarily implemented at a group-wide level. A forward-looking functional landscape highlights two trends The bottom-up analysis of the 70 fintechs helped us construct a functional landscape that identifies two major themes — datalytics and platform — as the two primary building blocks of the capital markets of tomorrow. This segmentation can currently be observed in tech and retail industries, where large market players like Google and Amazon are leveraging both datalytics and platforms to drive their businesses. Within the financial services sector, even conventional industries — banking and insurance — are starting to shift toward new operating models where they turn insights into action by exploiting their large amounts of data on new powerful and flexible platforms. Based on the startups’ innovative activities, we defined 11 essential functional categories that fall into four large families within the two macro groups. We defined a separate twelfth functional category as an end-to-end solution and classified it as both a family and a macro group. Figure 1 shows a breakdown of this view. For definition purposes, each startup was assigned to one functional category corresponding to its main business solution. If a fintech works across a spectrum of solutions, it belongs to the end-to-end (E2E) functional category. Figure 1.

In this, we have randomly selected 13 of the 70 fintechs and are representing their position within the functional landscape. The 13 fintechs include: 1. AlgoDynamix, London 2. Ascent, Chicago 3.

Although investment banks typically deal with large amounts of data, until now they have been relatively slow in understanding that data is a digital treasure trove. Data management targets a wide spectrum of applications such as internal and external data collection, intelligent data processing using data lakes, data analysis to generate alpha and business opportunities, and data visualization/interpretation to create a client-driven user experience. • Risk management and control is essential to capital markets due to the pivotal role it plays in the global economy. Risk management and controls in the banking industry are set up for multiple reasons, including reducing systemic risk, protecting customers and monitoring fraudulent activities. Platform The platform macro group is also composed of two families: market infrastructure and internal infrastructure. Both families offer customizable, scalable, adaptable and integrated systems on which to build and run business activities. • Market infrastructure focuses on revenue-generating solutions, especially in new high-potential market segments such as digital asset exchanges and OTC exchanges. • Internal infrastructure is driven by efficiency and automation objectives that involve entirely overhauling the operations infrastructure or optimizing current activity processes. Figure 3. Functional families and macro group definitions Macro Group Definitions Families Definitions Datalytics Datalytics represents collection, management, analysis and processing of data. Risk management & control The purpose of risk management and control is to ensure that the company’s operations are run efficiently, that information (financial and other) is reliable and that the company complies with the relevant regulations. The main phases are risk identification, risk assessment, risk control and risk monitoring. Data management Data management is a set of processes by which data is internally captured, validated, stored, protected and managed. Data management also includes data intelligence, which is a process that transforms raw data into useful information and actionable insights. Platform A platform is a customizable, scalable, adaptable and integrated system on which one builds and runs business activities. Market infrastructure Market infrastructure is a multifunctional system connecting market participants in an integrated manner and used for the purpose of carrying out business activities (deal creation and execution, trading, syndication, new asset classes, client- oriented services). Internal infrastructure Internal infrastructure is a platform used to improve process efficiency (such as optimization and automation) within an organization. White Paper 7 A relative-strength fintech map lets the data tell the story In the first half of the study, we used a bottom-up approach to define a functional map of the capital markets of tomorrow. In the second part, we used a statistical approach with a relative-strength fintech map to let the data tell the story. We went from a complex multi-dimensional and impossible-to-visualize dataset to a simple and impactful visualization of the fintech population according to two simple dimensions: life cycle and disruption potential. Theoretically, the statistical process follows three steps: 1) aggregate data, 2) establish a model in N dimensions to explain the fintech ecosystem and 3) apply a principal component analysis (PCA) to give a visual representation of this N-dimensional model in a 2D graph. PCA is a statistical technique used to shrink dimensions of a dataset. As the name suggests, it identifies the principal components that best fit the dataset. These artificial dimensions capture the largest amount of information possible. Our example here uses a dataset with two dimensions (Dimension 1 and Dimension 2), reducing two dimensions to one, but this statistical approach also applies to datasets with more than two dimensions. Figure 4 represents 100 percent of the information of the dataset, as every observation point is described on both dimensions. PC 1 in Figure 5 represents the line of best fit. The PCA minimizes the average distance of the observations (dotted lines) from the principal component. Figure 4. Dataset before dimensional reduction Dimension 2 Observation 2 Dimension 1 Value of Observation 2 for Dimension 2 Value of Observation 2 for Dimension 1 Figure 5. Dimensional reduction on a principal component Dimension 2 Observation 2 PC 1 Dimension 1 White Paper 8 In Figure 6, the compressed dataset is visualized on just one principal component. How aggregating populations identifies common characteristics Once the dimensional reduction has been done, it is important to extract as much information as possible from the data. We used hierarchical clustering (HC) to group companies with similar characteristics. To define clusters, the algorithm compares the distance between points inside clusters and, through multiple iterations, determines the optimal clusters. A second condition in defining the clusters is maximizing the distance between them. As before, the intuition behind this technique is best described with a series of graphs. The dataset in Figure 7 has two dimensions. Hierarchical clustering computes the distance between each point (observation) and identifies the two closest ones. These are grouped together, creating the first cluster. The centroid of this cluster is computed by averaging the value of the two points for the two dimensions. Figure 6. Visualization of a dataset on a principal component Figure 7. Cluster identification through minimization of distance between data points Figure 8. Cluster iterations Observation 2 PC 1 Value of Observation 2 for PC 1 (2;2) (3;2) (4;3) (6;4) (8;4) (8;2) (2,5;2) (1;1) (2;2) (3;2) (4;3) (6;4) (8;4) (8;2) (2,5;2) (1;1) (3;2,3) White Paper 9 The centroid is used to compute the distance from the first cluster to the other observations (Figure 8). HC repeats the same process as before and finds the closest two points in the dataset (in this case, one observation and the cluster created previously) and groups them to create a bigger cluster. The centroid of this new cluster is computed by averaging the values for the two dimensions of the three points that make up the cluster. The HC algorithm repeats the same process until it ends up with the number of wanted clusters — two, in this example (Figure 9). This algorithm can be used on datasets with more than two dimensions. In our case, we used seven dimensions to cluster the startups into three groups. 7D model dives deeper into fintech characteristics The bottom-up approach gave us an insightful functional view on what characterizes fintechs. By delving deeper into the analysis of the 70 selected startups, seven variables emerged that consistently defined the DNA of each startup: partnerships, clients, workforce, innovation, scope of solution, ease of deployment and maturity (Figure 10). We used only six dimensions for the PCA, removing “ease of deployment” because it reduced the correlation between the two principal components that the model had generated — life cycle and disruption potential. However, we used all seven dimensions to create three clusters that characterize the full population of startups. Figure 9. Results of a 2 HC algorithm Figure 10. Fintech DNA — seven characteristic dimensions (2;2) (3;2) (4;3) (6;4) (8;2) (2,5;2) (7,3;3,3) (1;1) (8;4) Clients Partnerships Maturity Innovation Workforce Scope of solution Ease of deployment White Paper 10 We applied the results of the statistical analysis to our fintech model and visualized the complex ecosystem of fintechs in a simple 2D graphical representation, shown in Figure 11, that represents the relative positions of startups. This means that replicating this analysis periodically would provide an evolving view of the dynamics at play in the fintech capital markets ecosystem. The “life cycle” axis on the graph represents the startups’ level of maturity in the broadest sense — product development and client relationship. The “disruption potential” axis characterizes the technological solutions level of advancement in terms of scale and innovation. The graphical representation can be broken down into three distinctive clusters with specific characteristics, as summarized in Figure 12. Each cluster — bets, established and growth — has very specific characteristics. Financial institutions (as well as systems integrators and consulting companies) need to look at the features separately and/or comparatively to define which attributes best correspond to their business requirements. Figure 12. Cluster attributes Bets (9) Established (20) Growth (41) • High disruption potential • Architecture overhaul • Early stage maturity • Large scope of application • Strong potential • Plug and play • Mature solutions • Broad scope of application • Moderate innovation level • Narrow scope of solutions • Varied life cycle stage Three clusters Figure 11. Relative strength fintech map Life cycle Disruption potential White Paper 11 The attractiveness of each cluster varies depending on an organization’s time horizon, available resources, objectives and nature of the desired relationship. Institutions that value fast time to market and quick return on investment may find the startups within the “established” cluster more interesting. Companies looking for fintechs with high disruptive potential may want to focus on fintechs in the “bets” cluster. Innovative analysis can help financial institutions reach their goals Startups are in a strong position to help financial institutions attain their goals, whether through proofs of concept (POCs), partnerships, accelerator/incubator projects, investment and/or acquisitions. DXC’s innovative approach to analyzing capital markets views the startup ecosystem from two different angles to present a clear view of fintech startups’ characteristics and DNA — and help you determine which company can best meet your needs. Our bottom-up analysis of a selected population of 70 innovative and specialized fintechs defined the capital markets landscape lying ahead of us. The compelling outcome was the emergence of two macro groups at the heart of the industry: datalytics and platform. Our statistical analysis established a relative strength fintech map. To create this simple graphical representation, we created a 7D model and used a PCA and HC algorithm to extract insights from the data gathered. The results indicated three broad clusters — bets, established and growth — with each aggregate corresponding to financial institutions’ different business needs. The relative nature of the fintech map means that we will be using this benchmark as a point of comparison, going forward, updating it periodically to track any important shifts in the market. To further prove the robustness of our model, future versions will include a broader population of startups and cover a more varied geographical selection. We hope this research — either standalone or in conjunction with deeper analysis and personalized guidance with DXC’s new fintech consulting service — will help financial institutions leverage emerging technology to generate new sources of revenue, reduce costs and digitize processes.

This paper details the comprehensive study and methodology behind a new DXC Technology consulting service that uses innovative, in-depth analysis to help financial services firms untangle the world of fintechs and systematically choose the one that's right for them.  White Paper Helping financial institutions choose a startup and reach their goals Find the right fintech partner White Paper 2 Find the right fintech partner Financial services institutions are experiencing a wave of innovation like never before. Regulatory requirements, ever-increasing customer expectations and fierce competition from new entrants are narrowing margins and pushing institutions involved in capital markets to look for new ways to transform their operations and reach maximum efficiency. Concurrently, emerging technologies are maturing enough to be used for large-scale, enterprise-grade applications. In this rapidly changing environment, an increasing number of fintech startups have decided to collaborate with financial institutions. Fintech startups — with their fresh look at the industry and capacity to innovate without some of the restrictions burdening big companies — are proposing new ways to operate and interact with customers. They are partnering with financial institutions to offer solutions that generate new sources of revenue, reduce costs and digitize, optimize and automate processes. With an ever-increasing number of innovative fintechs in the capital markets landscape, however, it is becoming more difficult for financial organizations to assess which solutions best suit their needs. This paper details the comprehensive study and methodology behind a new DXC Technology consulting service that uses innovative, in-depth analysis to help you untangle the world of fintechs and identify the most appropriate ones for your business activities. Right out of the gate, fintech startups have an advantage over legacy systems distributors and affirmed vendors: They have no legacy and/or cumbersome infrastructures. They can offer a brand-new and more efficient way of handling data and processes. They are not bound by bureaucracy and are therefore able to propose highly innovative solutions in revenue-generating functional areas such as new digital asset markets. DXC’s study focuses on a limited sample of 70 startups that meet three criteria: 1) innovative solutions, 2) less than 10 years in business and 3) specialization in the capital markets industry. Our approach is designed to help financial organizations determine which solutions are right for them, without getting bogged down in excessive evaluation. Our startup study does not cover the entire scope of capital markets — for instance, it omits listed securities trading, which is already mature in terms of revenue generation, cost efficiency and digitization. However, since fintech startups are highly dependent on funding from market participants, they can be considered indicators of the direction the entire capital markets industry is headed. Our study first establishes a forward-looking capital markets functional landscape determined through the analysis of today’s fintech startup ecosystem. A bottom-up approach focuses on the fundamentals underpinning startups for a clear view of which functional areas of the value chain innovative fintech companies pay the most attention to. This approach ensures that we are not biased toward current offerings Table of contents What is driving change? 3 A forward-looking functional landscape highlights two trends 4 A relative-strength fintech map lets the data tell the story 7 Innovative analysis can help financial institutions reach their goals 10 White Paper 3 in today’s capital markets and will not inadvertently reproduce a similar landscape. Disruptive digital technologies are revolutionizing how businesses should be run, and we believe that a top-down approach would lack the accuracy needed to assess and compare startups. We then use a statistical approach to transform the representation of a complex multidimensional startup ecosystem into a relative strength fintech map that plots the startups according to two easily understandable dimensions: disruption potential and life cycle. What is driving change? Three main factors are driving mutations in the capital markets industry: new sources of revenue; cost reduction; and digitization, optimization and automation. New sources of revenue New competition is forcing companies to seek new sources of revenue. The forex (FX) transaction market, for instance, was historically the exclusive prerogative of big financial institutions able to apply hefty margins on non-institutional clients. Today new entrants, such as Revolut and Kantox, offer services ranging from cheaper FX transactions to international transfers, and this has put considerable pressure on big banks to reduce markups. From another standpoint, the 2008 financial crisis prompted regulations to stabilize markets and protect clients. New layers of bureaucracy are redefining the relationship between institutions and clients and pushing financial firms to move away from traditional business models. It is now clearly in the interest of financial companies to explore new services and products and innovative ways of delivering their core businesses. Recently, for example, there has been a move toward developing cryptocurrency exchanges and digital currencies. Cost reduction As data predominates in the digital era, data management becomes a strategic priority for financial institutions. Yet over time, their legacy IT infrastructure has become a fragmented network of systems built for different purposes and stacked in successive layers — an infrastructure that can no longer deal with a more complex and demanding digital environment. A variety of options are now available to help companies manage, store, clean, analyze and report data. These choices include 1) developing solutions internally or with external providers and 2) overhauling or improving the existing infrastructure. Since 2008, new regulations — including EMIR, MiFID II, FATCA, SFTR, MMSR and Basel — have weighed heavily on the financial industry’s balance sheets. Compliance costs have put pressure on businesses to keep up with mandatory regulation changes. Numerous fines — including an $8.9 billion U.S. fine on BNP Paribas for breaching the Iran embargo — have forced companies to add provisions for their liabilities.  White Paper 4 Digitization, optimization and automation As clients demand more flexibility and access to services through mobile devices and other channels, major banks and asset managers are considering the innovation path of digitization, optimization and automation. Various players in the capital markets industry are already investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for pre-trade and execution activities as well as in robotic process automation (RPA) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) — the technology supporting blockchain — for post-trade activities. This trend toward innovation, however, is not widespread across the industry, nor necessarily implemented at a group-wide level. A forward-looking functional landscape highlights two trends The bottom-up analysis of the 70 fintechs helped us construct a functional landscape that identifies two major themes — datalytics and platform — as the two primary building blocks of the capital markets of tomorrow. This segmentation can currently be observed in tech and retail industries, where large market players like Google and Amazon are leveraging both datalytics and platforms to drive their businesses. Within the financial services sector, even conventional industries — banking and insurance — are starting to shift toward new operating models where they turn insights into action by exploiting their large amounts of data on new powerful and flexible platforms. Based on the startups’ innovative activities, we defined 11 essential functional categories that fall into four large families within the two macro groups. We defined a separate twelfth functional category as an end-to-end solution and classified it as both a family and a macro group. Figure 1 shows a breakdown of this view. For definition purposes, each startup was assigned to one functional category corresponding to its main business solution. If a fintech works across a spectrum of solutions, it belongs to the end-to-end (E2E) functional category. Figure 1.

In this, we have randomly selected 13 of the 70 fintechs and are representing their position within the functional landscape. The 13 fintechs include: 1. AlgoDynamix, London 2. Ascent, Chicago 3.

Although investment banks typically deal with large amounts of data, until now they have been relatively slow in understanding that data is a digital treasure trove. Data management targets a wide spectrum of applications such as internal and external data collection, intelligent data processing using data lakes, data analysis to generate alpha and business opportunities, and data visualization/interpretation to create a client-driven user experience. • Risk management and control is essential to capital markets due to the pivotal role it plays in the global economy. Risk management and controls in the banking industry are set up for multiple reasons, including reducing systemic risk, protecting customers and monitoring fraudulent activities. Platform The platform macro group is also composed of two families: market infrastructure and internal infrastructure. Both families offer customizable, scalable, adaptable and integrated systems on which to build and run business activities. • Market infrastructure focuses on revenue-generating solutions, especially in new high-potential market segments such as digital asset exchanges and OTC exchanges. • Internal infrastructure is driven by efficiency and automation objectives that involve entirely overhauling the operations infrastructure or optimizing current activity processes. Figure 3. Functional families and macro group definitions Macro Group Definitions Families Definitions Datalytics Datalytics represents collection, management, analysis and processing of data. Risk management & control The purpose of risk management and control is to ensure that the company’s operations are run efficiently, that information (financial and other) is reliable and that the company complies with the relevant regulations. The main phases are risk identification, risk assessment, risk control and risk monitoring. Data management Data management is a set of processes by which data is internally captured, validated, stored, protected and managed. Data management also includes data intelligence, which is a process that transforms raw data into useful information and actionable insights. Platform A platform is a customizable, scalable, adaptable and integrated system on which one builds and runs business activities. Market infrastructure Market infrastructure is a multifunctional system connecting market participants in an integrated manner and used for the purpose of carrying out business activities (deal creation and execution, trading, syndication, new asset classes, client- oriented services). Internal infrastructure Internal infrastructure is a platform used to improve process efficiency (such as optimization and automation) within an organization. White Paper 7 A relative-strength fintech map lets the data tell the story In the first half of the study, we used a bottom-up approach to define a functional map of the capital markets of tomorrow. In the second part, we used a statistical approach with a relative-strength fintech map to let the data tell the story. We went from a complex multi-dimensional and impossible-to-visualize dataset to a simple and impactful visualization of the fintech population according to two simple dimensions: life cycle and disruption potential. Theoretically, the statistical process follows three steps: 1) aggregate data, 2) establish a model in N dimensions to explain the fintech ecosystem and 3) apply a principal component analysis (PCA) to give a visual representation of this N-dimensional model in a 2D graph. PCA is a statistical technique used to shrink dimensions of a dataset. As the name suggests, it identifies the principal components that best fit the dataset. These artificial dimensions capture the largest amount of information possible. Our example here uses a dataset with two dimensions (Dimension 1 and Dimension 2), reducing two dimensions to one, but this statistical approach also applies to datasets with more than two dimensions. Figure 4 represents 100 percent of the information of the dataset, as every observation point is described on both dimensions. PC 1 in Figure 5 represents the line of best fit. The PCA minimizes the average distance of the observations (dotted lines) from the principal component. Figure 4. Dataset before dimensional reduction Dimension 2 Observation 2 Dimension 1 Value of Observation 2 for Dimension 2 Value of Observation 2 for Dimension 1 Figure 5. Dimensional reduction on a principal component Dimension 2 Observation 2 PC 1 Dimension 1 White Paper 8 In Figure 6, the compressed dataset is visualized on just one principal component. How aggregating populations identifies common characteristics Once the dimensional reduction has been done, it is important to extract as much information as possible from the data. We used hierarchical clustering (HC) to group companies with similar characteristics. To define clusters, the algorithm compares the distance between points inside clusters and, through multiple iterations, determines the optimal clusters. A second condition in defining the clusters is maximizing the distance between them. As before, the intuition behind this technique is best described with a series of graphs. The dataset in Figure 7 has two dimensions. Hierarchical clustering computes the distance between each point (observation) and identifies the two closest ones. These are grouped together, creating the first cluster. The centroid of this cluster is computed by averaging the value of the two points for the two dimensions. Figure 6. Visualization of a dataset on a principal component Figure 7. Cluster identification through minimization of distance between data points Figure 8. Cluster iterations Observation 2 PC 1 Value of Observation 2 for PC 1 (2;2) (3;2) (4;3) (6;4) (8;4) (8;2) (2,5;2) (1;1) (2;2) (3;2) (4;3) (6;4) (8;4) (8;2) (2,5;2) (1;1) (3;2,3) White Paper 9 The centroid is used to compute the distance from the first cluster to the other observations (Figure 8). HC repeats the same process as before and finds the closest two points in the dataset (in this case, one observation and the cluster created previously) and groups them to create a bigger cluster. The centroid of this new cluster is computed by averaging the values for the two dimensions of the three points that make up the cluster. The HC algorithm repeats the same process until it ends up with the number of wanted clusters — two, in this example (Figure 9). This algorithm can be used on datasets with more than two dimensions. In our case, we used seven dimensions to cluster the startups into three groups. 7D model dives deeper into fintech characteristics The bottom-up approach gave us an insightful functional view on what characterizes fintechs. By delving deeper into the analysis of the 70 selected startups, seven variables emerged that consistently defined the DNA of each startup: partnerships, clients, workforce, innovation, scope of solution, ease of deployment and maturity (Figure 10). We used only six dimensions for the PCA, removing “ease of deployment” because it reduced the correlation between the two principal components that the model had generated — life cycle and disruption potential. However, we used all seven dimensions to create three clusters that characterize the full population of startups. Figure 9. Results of a 2 HC algorithm Figure 10.

This means that replicating this analysis periodically would provide an evolving view of the dynamics at play in the fintech capital markets ecosystem. The “life cycle” axis on the graph represents the startups’ level of maturity in the broadest sense — product development and client relationship. The “disruption potential” axis characterizes the technological solutions level of advancement in terms of scale and innovation. The graphical representation can be broken down into three distinctive clusters with specific characteristics, as summarized in Figure 12. Each cluster — bets, established and growth — has very specific characteristics. Financial institutions (as well as systems integrators and consulting companies) need to look at the features separately and/or comparatively to define which attributes best correspond to their business requirements. Figure 12. Cluster attributes Bets (9) Established (20) Growth (41) • High disruption potential • Architecture overhaul • Early stage maturity • Large scope of application • Strong potential • Plug and play • Mature solutions • Broad scope of application • Moderate innovation level • Narrow scope of solutions • Varied life cycle stage Three clusters Figure 11. Relative strength fintech map Life cycle Disruption potential White Paper 11 The attractiveness of each cluster varies depending on an organization’s time horizon, available resources, objectives and nature of the desired relationship. Institutions that value fast time to market and quick return on investment may find the startups within the “established” cluster more interesting. Companies looking for fintechs with high disruptive potential may want to focus on fintechs in the “bets” cluster.

Most companies establish these as separate support functions when new. Once they mature, these services can be consolidated and simplified. Using an integrated support model, DXC Technology’s HR Service Desk allows enterprises to begin the consolidation journey by merging HR and IT support services into a single support organization. Enable a new support experience A seamless, simplified support choice benefits employees, helping them get answers and assistance faster. And, it sets the stage to incorporate new support experiences that are continually expanding. Unified support portals, virtual agents, user analytics, proactive support, predictive analytics, videos kiosks, walk-in centers and mobile applications are just a few of the advanced methods IT support organizations can employ to provide an effective and efficient support channel for each individual. Ordinarily, enabling these experiences for an HR service desk can be cost prohibitive. However, DXC’s approach is to enable these capabilities for IT first, then extend them to support HR and other business functions. This offers employees a consistent experience regardless of their support needs. Optimize delivery HR questions are challenging; every person has unique needs. To offer effective, personalized service, a well-run service desk requires a number of key functional processes and staff members to ensure that service agents can resolve issues quickly. DXC’s support model leverages all the features and functions from the DXC IT Service Desk, so they can benefit HR without a significant impact on overall costs. DXC’s approach also optimizes agent staffing and delivery structure. Our solution incorporates Guardian Agents, experts in HR applications who also serve as dedicated case managers. These resources help ensure that employee issues can be resolved during the first contact. In addition, we embed specialists who are familiar with your HR systems (e.g., Workday, payroll systems), so that even the toughest, most complicated questions can be answered correctly. DXC’s case management resources make sure that complex inquiries are escalated and receive a fast, thorough response. Our delivery approach creates benefits for you, your budget and your employees.

Services for an integrated enterprise • Benefit from one contact for both HR and IT support • Leverage support capabilities too expensive to deploy for HR only • Provide personalized, native- language HR support for many employees and regions • Build on a world-class delivery organization and platform Work with the best: DXC Technology • Supports more than 65 million contacts per year • Provides support in 56 languages • Delivers via 69 service desk locations globally • Enjoys a customer satisfaction rating of 92% • Resolves more than 70% of first contacts Support calls about human resources (HR) and IT typically represent the largest number of service desk calls in an enterprise. Most companies establish these as separate support functions when new. Once they mature, these services can be consolidated and simplified. Using an integrated support model, DXC Technology’s HR Service Desk allows enterprises to begin the consolidation journey by merging HR and IT support services into a single support organization. Enable a new support experience A seamless, simplified support choice benefits employees, helping them get answers and assistance faster. And, it sets the stage to incorporate new support experiences that are continually expanding. Unified support portals, virtual agents, user analytics, proactive support, predictive analytics, videos kiosks, walk-in centers and mobile applications are just a few of the advanced methods IT support organizations can employ to provide an effective and efficient support channel for each individual. Ordinarily, enabling these experiences for an HR service desk can be cost prohibitive. However, DXC’s approach is to enable these capabilities for IT first, then extend them to support HR and other business functions. This offers employees a consistent experience regardless of their support needs. Optimize delivery HR questions are challenging; every person has unique needs. To offer effective, personalized service, a well-run service desk requires a number of key functional processes and staff members to ensure that service agents can resolve issues quickly. DXC’s support model leverages all the features and functions from the DXC IT Service Desk, so they can benefit HR without a significant impact on overall costs. DXC’s approach also optimizes agent staffing and delivery structure. Our solution incorporates Guardian Agents, experts in HR applications who also serve as dedicated case managers. These resources help ensure that employee issues can be resolved during the first contact. In addition, we embed specialists who are familiar with your HR systems (e.g., Workday, payroll systems), so that even the toughest, most complicated questions can be answered correctly. DXC’s case management resources make sure that complex inquiries are escalated and receive a fast, thorough response. Our delivery approach creates benefits for you, your budget and your employees. It also delivers measured, proven results. Instead of typical SLAs that measure how quickly phones are answered, we measure success based on user satisfaction.

All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Leverage these trends for success in 2019 and beyond Worker productivity has not changed materially in over 20 years — not since email and internet services permeated the office. But the pervasive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in business, coupled with collaborative systems, internetworked teams and tech-savvy business leaders, signals that we are getting closer to the next step change in productivity. DXC Technology’s 2020 vision for the future of work shows enterprises continuing to reap the rewards of technology to drive business growth — and getting the people part of the equation right is essential. Employees who feel inspired and collaborate well perform better than the rest: An engaged employee is 44 percent more productive than a satisfied worker, but an employee who feels inspired at work is nearly 125 percent more productive than a satisfied one, according to the Bain & Co. publication Time, Talent, Energy: Overcome Organizational Drag and Unleash Your Team’s Productive Power. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that better communication and collaboration through social technologies (as opposed to, say, email) could raise the productivity of knowledge workers by 20 to 25 percent. It pays to get this right. Research reported in the book Accelerate, which details Agile/DevOps techniques at scale, indicated that high-performing organizations “had 50 percent higher market capitalization growth over three years compared to low performers.” As our 2020 trends show, whether it’s through AI, the internet of things (IoT), data ecosystems or how we organize around teams and lead, enterprises are reaching new levels of productivity and innovation. 2  Professional services firms will struggle with how AI can — or should — change their professions, such as legal, accounting, healthcare and education For consumers, AI will democratize access to professional services For professionals, AI will provide new insights, manage information overload, reduce human error But professionals’ critical reasoning skills could atrophy, making it difficult to train the next generation of experts November 14, 2019 3 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. AI redefines professional services AI will bring forward intelligence hidden in systems, empowering consumers and complementing professionals’ expertise.

November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. In 2020, professional services firms will struggle with how AI can — or should — change their professions. AI is revolutionizing professions such as legal, accounting, healthcare and education in two ways: democratization and decision support. AI democratizes professional services by extending customization and personalized services to a broad base of customers through low-cost intelligent agents. These software agents can augment and improve many aspects of our lives — but will not take them over. At the same time, AI will benefit professionals in those industries by providing new insights, managing information overload and reducing human error. As these decision-support systems get more sophisticated, though, professionals may come to rely on them too much, leaving them without the skills to pass on to others in the field. Companies will get a better understanding of whether there is a trade-off between democratization and using AI assistants on the one hand, and potential skill loss on the other. Leaders will define ideal interactions between AI agents and people, designing mutually beneficial outcomes. Businesses should protect against unintended consequences by training people to quickly detect improper bias or unsafe behavior of the AI and respond with corrective action. But overall, AI will bring forward intelligence hidden in systems, empowering consumers and complementing professionals’ expertise. 3 Processing will move to where the data is Machine-to-machine / internet of things world will accelerate IT modernization Analytics will continue moving to the network edge where the data is, and will help enterprises make better decisions faster, more accurately and more cheaply These design patterns will deliver richer experiences to consumers because they enable substantially more \"local\" processing with faster, better outcomes November 14, 2019 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. 4 Enterprises will realize new levels of efficiency and innovation by leveraging M2M/IoT data and the speed of M2M/IoT services. Design thinking shifts from IT services for people to IT services for machines November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Systems design thinking is shifting as IT services are increasingly designed for machines instead of people, and as processing moves to where data resides (extending trend #3 we predicted last year). This will usher in new design choices and transformational architectures, and will push companies to more aggressively pursue IT modernization. Enterprises will benefit from faster decisions, owing to the fact that microprocessors can make decisions in nanoseconds. Humans take a little longer (0.5 to 1 second). And those decisions will benefit from a richer, near-real-time dataset. Stream and batch processing architectures are constantly being updated with better machine-to-machine (M2M) capabilities. Analytics will continue moving to the network edge where the data is, and will use the reduced propagation delays to make better decisions faster and more cheaply. These design patterns deliver richer experiences to consumers because they enable substantially more “local” processing with faster, better outcomes. Consider driving. Signs range from smart parking meters to smart traffic signals to smart traffic flow to, eventually, fully autonomous cars and smart cities enabled by cooperative edges that won’t need to be connected to remote, centralized data centers. 4 Companies will realize data has more value when it is shared, such as in: Shared autonomous driving sensor data for R&D Shared healthcare data for better health outcomes Shared financial data for better investments But they will need to validate individuals’ rights to share data and enterprises’ rights to consume data This growth in data ecosystems will affect different groups: CEOs will identify and pursue ecosystem-centric business models and trading partners Line-of-business leaders will learn the importance of peer-to-peer consent management to ensure data compliance, and AI and analytics to discover new insights The technical community will create mechanisms for identity and consent  November 14, 2019 5 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Enterprises will share and monetize data in ecosystems to create new products, services and customer experiences. The value of data increases in ecosystems November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. The idea that information wants to be shared will be on full display in 2020 as enterprises pool their data in ecosystems to achieve business goals. Autonomous driving sensor data is being shared across car companies for use in their car models. Healthcare data can be shared across providers and public health agencies to improve health outcomes and personalized wellness outcomes. Financial data can be shared across banks and investment firms to get the best yields for a client-provided strategy. However, for these ecosystems to flourish, we need trust mechanisms that validate both the individual’s right to share and the enterprise’s right to consume data. Self-sovereign identity standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials based on zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain-based consent are emerging to address this. Through these technologies and a combination of AI, internet of things and distributed ledger technology, we will see manufacturers, service providers and consumers willing to share data in data exchanges. The value of these ecosystems will grow with increased consent from individuals to use their personal data, reinforced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). With these components in place, expect ecosystems to grow rapidly. CEOs will look to identify and pursue ecosystem-centric business models and trading partners, where trusted and compliant data sharing is fundamental to improving operations and offerings. Line-of-business leaders should understand that key to unlocking business value is peer-to-peer consent management to ensure data compliance, plus AI and analytics to discover new insights. Meanwhile, the technical community will be working to create mechanisms for identity and consent to help govern the use of our personal data and ensure that the value from this data is shared responsibly. 5  November 14, 2019 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Companies will reorganize around high-performing teams that understand the “big picture” and are empowered to make key decisions Teams will become multidisciplinary and interconnected to be more adaptable, the number-one priority for companies in a fast-changing market This approach will affect talent acquisition and development strategies, as companies seek team players with double-deep skills (business and technology) The result: a shift from 10x individuals to 20x teams The ability to develop and manage a network of high-performing teams will be key to business success in the 2020s. 6 Teams, not superstars, are the high performers November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Companies are starting to recognize that simply going faster (e.g., holding more meetings) doesn’t unlock the organization’s full potential; companies must create high-performing teams. Successful high-performing teams are empowered to make key decisions. These teams understand their mission and boundaries and are trusted. They communicate and share information across teams, with a record of who participated in the decision process and how. A flexible structure of multidisciplinary teams is adaptable and can provide many options, in contrast to the limited options of a traditional pyramid with siloed teams. Organizing for a dynamic and complex business environment requires talent acquisition and development strategies that rely heavily on interconnected teams of multidimensional individuals, rather than siloed teams of “superstars.” This shift from so-called 10x individuals to 20x teams is paramount for achieving speed, flexibility and business results. The focus is on making teams productive; the massive growth of team environments such as Slack and Microsoft Teams underscores the fact that enterprises are eager to harness this productivity. Teammates are double-deep (have both business and technology knowledge), learn from each other daily, discover synergies and optimize in ways that a less intimate model would not allow. People will participate in multiple diverse teams. Enterprises will restructure to expand interconnected teams across the whole organization. And ultimately, building better teams will build better individuals and enterprises. The ability to develop and manage a network of high-performing teams will be key to business success in the 2020s. 6  November 14, 2019 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. New tech-savvy business leaders will advocate how technologies can improve the enterprise’s speed, agility, productivity and innovation advantage 4 tips for becoming a modern business leader: Build awareness. Scout the emerging technology scene for trends and insights. Be more open. Participate in open initiatives and share thinking with partners or the wider marketplace. Get access to R&D. Establish ties with leading universities and government agencies, and look to apply R&D from one industry to another. Push agile culture. Focus on high-performing teams, experimentation and learning, and business outcomes. As more tech-savvy business leaders come to the fore, we’ll see more tangible business value realized from emerging technologies, and business transformations will accelerate. 7 A new wave of business leaders accelerates business transformation November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. A change in business leadership will gain momentum in 2020 as technology-driven marketplaces proliferate. New leaders will advocate for technologies that can improve the enterprise’s speed, agility, productivity and innovative advantage. As technology evangelists, these leaders work at the C level to shape digital strategy while engaging in major initiatives such as smart products, mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property development and learning. This is a different mission for technology leaders than providing IT, and it requires new skills and culture. These new leaders are needed in the middle of the organization, too, where inertia is often a challenge. Here are tips for becoming a modern business leader: Build awareness. Scout the emerging technology scene for trends and insights. Be more open. Participate in open initiatives and share thinking with partners or the wider marketplace. Get access to R&D. Establish ties with leading universities and government agencies, and look to apply R&D from one industry to another. Push agile culture. Focus on multidisciplinary teams, experimentation and learning, and business outcomes. Like their teams, the new leaders are double-deep, with a solid understanding of the business and technology. As they come to the fore, we’ll see more tangible business value realized from emerging technologies, and business transformations will accelerate. 7 www.dxc.technology/2020 #DXCTechTrends  November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

More to come Historically, significant technologies, from cotton gins to cars, were disruptive in the short term and highly controversial. Over the long term, these innovations and many others have reshaped economies and societies in many beneficial ways. Few would dispute that we’re in an era of unprecedented technology-enabled change. And yet the most significant phase, led by AI and machine learning, analytics, IoT and other data-driven technologies, is just now arriving. It’s likely that the way we define work and how we accomplish it will utterly change. And ultimately it will be for the better. I’d love to hear your views on these trends, and what trends you are seeing in the marketplace. Thank you. 8  ",

At the same time, AI will benefit professionals in those industries by providing new insights, managing information overload and reducing human error. As these decision-support systems get more sophisticated, though, professionals may come to rely on them too much, leaving them without the skills to pass on to others in the field. Companies will get a better understanding of whether there is a trade-off between democratization and using AI assistants on the one hand, and potential skill loss on the other. Leaders will define ideal interactions between AI agents and people, designing mutually beneficial outcomes. Businesses should protect against unintended consequences by training people to quickly detect improper bias or unsafe behavior of the AI and respond with corrective action. But overall, AI will bring forward intelligence hidden in systems, empowering consumers and complementing professionals’ expertise. 3 Processing will move to where the data is Machine-to-machine / internet of things world will accelerate IT modernization Analytics will continue moving to the network edge where the data is, and will help enterprises make better decisions faster, more accurately and more cheaply These design patterns will deliver richer experiences to consumers because they enable substantially more \"local\" processing with faster, better outcomes November 14, 2019 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. 4 Enterprises will realize new levels of efficiency and innovation by leveraging M2M/IoT data and the speed of M2M/IoT services. Design thinking shifts from IT services for people to IT services for machines November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Systems design thinking is shifting as IT services are increasingly designed for machines instead of people, and as processing moves to where data resides (extending trend #3 we predicted last year). This will usher in new design choices and transformational architectures, and will push companies to more aggressively pursue IT modernization. Enterprises will benefit from faster decisions, owing to the fact that microprocessors can make decisions in nanoseconds. Humans take a little longer (0.5 to 1 second). And those decisions will benefit from a richer, near-real-time dataset. Stream and batch processing architectures are constantly being updated with better machine-to-machine (M2M) capabilities. Analytics will continue moving to the network edge where the data is, and will use the reduced propagation delays to make better decisions faster and more cheaply. These design patterns deliver richer experiences to consumers because they enable substantially more “local” processing with faster, better outcomes. Consider driving. Signs range from smart parking meters to smart traffic signals to smart traffic flow to, eventually, fully autonomous cars and smart cities enabled by cooperative edges that won’t need to be connected to remote, centralized data centers. 4 Companies will realize data has more value when it is shared, such as in: Shared autonomous driving sensor data for R&D Shared healthcare data for better health outcomes Shared financial data for better investments But they will need to validate individuals’ rights to share data and enterprises’ rights to consume data This growth in data ecosystems will affect different groups: CEOs will identify and pursue ecosystem-centric business models and trading partners Line-of-business leaders will learn the importance of peer-to-peer consent management to ensure data compliance, and AI and analytics to discover new insights The technical community will create mechanisms for identity and consent  November 14, 2019 5 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Enterprises will share and monetize data in ecosystems to create new products, services and customer experiences. The value of data increases in ecosystems November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. The idea that information wants to be shared will be on full display in 2020 as enterprises pool their data in ecosystems to achieve business goals. Autonomous driving sensor data is being shared across car companies for use in their car models. Healthcare data can be shared across providers and public health agencies to improve health outcomes and personalized wellness outcomes. Financial data can be shared across banks and investment firms to get the best yields for a client-provided strategy. However, for these ecosystems to flourish, we need trust mechanisms that validate both the individual’s right to share and the enterprise’s right to consume data. Self-sovereign identity standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials based on zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain-based consent are emerging to address this. Through these technologies and a combination of AI, internet of things and distributed ledger technology, we will see manufacturers, service providers and consumers willing to share data in data exchanges. The value of these ecosystems will grow with increased consent from individuals to use their personal data, reinforced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). With these components in place, expect ecosystems to grow rapidly. CEOs will look to identify and pursue ecosystem-centric business models and trading partners, where trusted and compliant data sharing is fundamental to improving operations and offerings. Line-of-business leaders should understand that key to unlocking business value is peer-to-peer consent management to ensure data compliance, plus AI and analytics to discover new insights. Meanwhile, the technical community will be working to create mechanisms for identity and consent to help govern the use of our personal data and ensure that the value from this data is shared responsibly. 5  November 14, 2019 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Companies will reorganize around high-performing teams that understand the “big picture” and are empowered to make key decisions Teams will become multidisciplinary and interconnected to be more adaptable, the number-one priority for companies in a fast-changing market This approach will affect talent acquisition and development strategies, as companies seek team players with double-deep skills (business and technology) The result: a shift from 10x individuals to 20x teams The ability to develop and manage a network of high-performing teams will be key to business success in the 2020s. 6 Teams, not superstars, are the high performers November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Companies are starting to recognize that simply going faster (e.g., holding more meetings) doesn’t unlock the organization’s full potential; companies must create high-performing teams. Successful high-performing teams are empowered to make key decisions. These teams understand their mission and boundaries and are trusted. They communicate and share information across teams, with a record of who participated in the decision process and how. A flexible structure of multidisciplinary teams is adaptable and can provide many options, in contrast to the limited options of a traditional pyramid with siloed teams. Organizing for a dynamic and complex business environment requires talent acquisition and development strategies that rely heavily on interconnected teams of multidimensional individuals, rather than siloed teams of “superstars.” This shift from so-called 10x individuals to 20x teams is paramount for achieving speed, flexibility and business results. The focus is on making teams productive; the massive growth of team environments such as Slack and Microsoft Teams underscores the fact that enterprises are eager to harness this productivity. Teammates are double-deep (have both business and technology knowledge), learn from each other daily, discover synergies and optimize in ways that a less intimate model would not allow. People will participate in multiple diverse teams. Enterprises will restructure to expand interconnected teams across the whole organization. And ultimately, building better teams will build better individuals and enterprises. The ability to develop and manage a network of high-performing teams will be key to business success in the 2020s. 6  November 14, 2019 © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. New tech-savvy business leaders will advocate how technologies can improve the enterprise’s speed, agility, productivity and innovation advantage 4 tips for becoming a modern business leader: Build awareness. Scout the emerging technology scene for trends and insights. Be more open. Participate in open initiatives and share thinking with partners or the wider marketplace. Get access to R&D. Establish ties with leading universities and government agencies, and look to apply R&D from one industry to another. Push agile culture. Focus on high-performing teams, experimentation and learning, and business outcomes. As more tech-savvy business leaders come to the fore, we’ll see more tangible business value realized from emerging technologies, and business transformations will accelerate. 7 A new wave of business leaders accelerates business transformation November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. A change in business leadership will gain momentum in 2020 as technology-driven marketplaces proliferate. New leaders will advocate for technologies that can improve the enterprise’s speed, agility, productivity and innovative advantage. As technology evangelists, these leaders work at the C level to shape digital strategy while engaging in major initiatives such as smart products, mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property development and learning. This is a different mission for technology leaders than providing IT, and it requires new skills and culture. These new leaders are needed in the middle of the organization, too, where inertia is often a challenge. Here are tips for becoming a modern business leader: Build awareness. Scout the emerging technology scene for trends and insights. Be more open. Participate in open initiatives and share thinking with partners or the wider marketplace. Get access to R&D. Establish ties with leading universities and government agencies, and look to apply R&D from one industry to another. Push agile culture. Focus on multidisciplinary teams, experimentation and learning, and business outcomes. Like their teams, the new leaders are double-deep, with a solid understanding of the business and technology. As they come to the fore, we’ll see more tangible business value realized from emerging technologies, and business transformations will accelerate. 7 www.dxc.technology/2020 #DXCTechTrends  November 14, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

More to come Historically, significant technologies, from cotton gins to cars, were disruptive in the short term and highly controversial. Over the long term, these innovations and many others have reshaped economies and societies in many beneficial ways. Few would dispute that we’re in an era of unprecedented technology-enabled change. And yet the most significant phase, led by AI and machine learning, analytics, IoT and other data-driven technologies, is just now arriving. It’s likely that the way we define work and how we accomplish it will utterly change. And ultimately it will be for the better. I’d love to hear your views on these trends, and what trends you are seeing in the marketplace. Thank you. 8  ",

Don’t minimize the required focus on people and culture change. Building a performance-oriented culture and driving a continuous improvement mindset takes time. The workforce pivot must involve change from the top to the bottom of the organization. (modernizing skills, evolving workflows, new ways of recognition) Hyper collaboration is required – a new way of working that continues to break down organizational walls and commercial impediments. True co-creation that integrates IP achieving a more complete solution for the client. Flexible options but through a standard menu of products/services to keep costs low. A continued focus on business outcomes – technology is just the enabler. For most organizations, the path to digital requires a hybrid approach to manage legacy environments while integrating digital technologies and solutions. DXC can help clients fund their digital vision by extending the value of their legacy systems while reducing costs of their IT operations. Then, we operate it at scale. 14 About DXC Technology DXC Technology (DXC: NYSE) is the world’s leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, helping clients harness the power of innovation to thrive on change.

Analytics, lean and automation techniques resulted in a ~25% reduction in the costs of their managed environments. 7 Platform DXC: Digital-generation Delivery Platform Offerings built on Platform DXC exploit insights from our delivery transformation, in a repeatable, scalable way Intelligence Analytics engine uses AI and ML to enable agile and production-ready value generation from operational data Orchestration Organizes, executes, and tracks the processes and workflows required to perform automated actions Automation Automates work via a suite of technologies to drive efficiencies in delivery processes and enable business outcomes Core Foundational services integrate and protect, provide data integration and enable the platform to meet government, regional, and client unique security, data, and separation requirements  August 6, 2019 ‹#› © 2018 DXC Technology Company Platform DXC includes three core pillars of services for our managed service offerings: Intelligence - A centralized analytics engine that enables agile and production-ready value generation from operational data. Actions performed span traditional reactive processing of data all the way up to more progressive complex machine learning and pattern matching capabilities. Orchestration - Organizes, executes, and tracks the processes and workflows required to perform automated actions. Automation - Encompasses the technologies that enable the mechanization of tasks and the capabilities that enhance functionality and efficiencies within the Platform DXC Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery process. In addition to the three “pillars,” there is a horizontal layer of services called “Core” that performs higher order functions to the managed environments they control. These foundational services integrate and protect Platform DXC. Platform DXC has been designed with several key tenets: flexibility, simplicity, use of partners, open source, etc. This represents a different way of working for our company: Intelligent automation built into our offerings from the start.

Don’t minimize the required focus on people and culture change. Building a performance-oriented culture and driving a continuous improvement mindset takes time. The workforce pivot must involve change from the top to the bottom of the organization. (modernizing skills, evolving workflows, new ways of recognition) Hyper collaboration is required – a new way of working that continues to break down organizational walls and commercial impediments. True co-creation that integrates IP achieving a more complete solution for the client. Flexible options but through a standard menu of products/services to keep costs low. A continued focus on business outcomes – technology is just the enabler. For most organizations, the path to digital requires a hybrid approach to manage legacy environments while integrating digital technologies and solutions. DXC can help clients fund their digital vision by extending the value of their legacy systems while reducing costs of their IT operations. Then, we operate it at scale. 14 About DXC Technology DXC Technology (DXC: NYSE) is the world’s leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, helping clients harness the power of innovation to thrive on change.

November 13, 2019 POR - SFDC Integration Network of Excellence (NoE) Overview November 13, 2019 2© 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Agenda • Welcome • What is the POR Integration? • Why are we deploying the POR Integration? • POR process flow • High level view of the current architecture • Review MoC Schedule • Impact to Opportunity Owners • Review steps in Salesforce • Q&A Note: The presentation and recording of today’s session will be posted to the NoE Chatter Group and sent by email. November 13, 2019 3© 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. What is the POR Integration into SFDC? • Automated process to capture Plan of Record (POR) data into SFDC • PORs are like a P&L for the deal. They are generated out of our Pricing Tools • POR’s contain monthly revenue and cost stacks for each Major Offering in the solution • The Pricing Tools can create “Interim” and “Final” POR’s • POR product information will be populated into SFDC and will “overlay” existing data in the Product Revenue Schedule. This includes existing data manually entered into SFDC or POR data updated previously • POR will be considered the ‘Gold Source” and changes (products/financials) will need to be made in the POR not into SFDC (The Product information in SFDC will be locked once a POR is uploaded). • The latest version of the POR will be loaded to SFDC. As you make changes to the POR and upload the POR to the POR Server, the updates will be applied into SFDC November 13, 2019 4© 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. Why are deploying the POR Integration? • Improve financial data accuracy in SFDC, especially in late stages of the pursuit • Provide the business greater accuracy in forecasting financial information associated with our sales • Provide tighter linkage between what we sell and what we report in our financial systems • Greatly reduce opportunity maintenance effort in SFDC. The user will update the POR only, not the POR and SFDC as we do today • Complete deal validation quicker (POR and SFDC will be in sync). No need to attach the POR as part of the Booking Validation process • Provide POR data to down-stream systems for reporting and audit purposes Opportunity Owner creates revenue schedule in SFDC by adding line items STOP POR matches SFDC YES START Opportunity Owner creates opportunity in SFDC Pricer creates POR in pricing tool SFDC loads POR Pricer updates POR in pricing tool Opportunity Owner updates line item information (1) Opportunity owner certifies and closes, puts in queue for sales booking team Sales booking team validates opportunity against POR and contract in SFDC No No Oppty Owner SFDC Pricer (Oppty Owner or member of pricing team) Sales Booking Stage 1 - 3 Stage 4 - 5 Stage 6 (1) POR is the “Gold Source” POR overlays what is in SFDC • SFDC Logic determines what to do if there is a product mismatch • POR will overlay what is in SFDC as a default • DoA approval but the offerings from POR do not sync with SFDC • SFDC needs to retain – OSS Assignment, Partner assignments, Major Sub- offerings when POR updates/overlays information in SFDC ISM Architecture & Process Flow SFDC 206314 Data Lake 208791 Business Objects 209157 Qlik 209156 Horizon BW 206883 Oppty Data w/ Financial Model Interim and Final POR Financial Model Booking Validation Process C A P TN 2 0 8 1 6 6 M o b y X p re ss 2 0 9 5 9 7 E3 T 2 0 7 3 0 3 Xpress Server 209597 1 3 5 Services Platform 209155 Services Platform 209155 4 Final Approved POR Financial Model 6 Financial / Backlog Reporting Sales Reporting w/ Financial Model POR Financial Model 1 - Pricer creates solution & financial model, generates PORs 1a - Xpress submits PORs to DXC SharePoint drop box (MIDAS) 1b - CAPTN, Moby, E3T POR files dropped to DXC SharePoint drobox by user (MIDAS) 2 - Sales Ops / Finance approves final PORs 2a - MIDAS obtains opportunity related data from Data Lake 2b - Integration Fabric to pull into SFDC. * Pull is every 20 minutes 2c - Opportunity Approved POR file copied to Xpress Server by MIDAS 3 - Sales Ops / Finance validates the sold opportunity 4 - Opportunity data flows to Data Lake automatically with financial model 5 - Approved POR is automatically copied to Horizon BW 6 - Financial & ASC606 Backlog reporting performed based on Horizon BW POR data 7 - Sales Reporting includes full interim and final financial models # Key Manual Process Automated Process New Automation # # Pricer (Solutioner, Bid Manager, Seller, Account Exec, etc…) Sales Booking Team Pricer 2 Services Platform 209155 Existing File drop 2b T&P Azure MIDAS 500018 File drop *API Existing API 2c Sales Booking Team 2a API Gateway 209151 1b 1a Enterprise Reporting (Horizon & Sales Reporting & Analytics) 7 DXC Proprietary and Confidential November 13, 2019 Email Campaign, Hot Topics and Drop-in Sessions • 11/4 – MOC session with the extended development team - COMPLETED • 11/6 – Awareness message to the NoE - COMPLETED • 11/6 – POR change overview with the Data Stewards - COMPLETED • 11/7 - Awareness email to all active SFDC users.

All rights reserved. How is the Opportunity Owner Impacted? • For late stage deals, no need to manage the Product information in SFDC. It will be loaded from the POR • Changes to the deal scope (products/financials) should be made in the Pricing tool. The POR generated by the Pricing tool will be fed to SFDC • Review the email messages when the POR load occurs. It will show you what was in SFDC and is in the POR • Make sure your Products in SFDC match the products you are entering in the Pricing tool. This will ensure you have no issues when you have the first POR load into SFDC • POR’s only go down to the Major Offering level. If you are using Major Sub-Offerings in your deal, SFDC will save the Major Sub-Offerings but you will need to allocate the revenue across the Major Sub-Offerings • OSS and Partner assignments are made at the product level. If the POR has different products, you may be asked to select new partners for these new offerings. The OSS assignment will be retained when there is a POR/SFDC match. If the POR and SFDC offerings do not match, the OSS assignment maybe lost. Please make sure to check the OSS assignments if you have received a POR/SFDC mis-match email • Make sure your “Lead Offering” for your DoA is accurate. If the deal is already DoA approved and if the offering changes due to POR load the final gate approval will be reset and opportunity owner has to redo the final governance gate • No need to upload the POR when going through the validation process © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

Opportunity owner creates a deal in SFDC with products. November 13, 2019 11© 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. SFDC – POR Offering Match (cont.): 2. Opportunity owner (or) Pricer creates Interim POR in pricing tool. 3. The Interim POR (Reporting) flows into MIDAS and reaches SFDC via NIFI Integrator. 4. The SFDC consumes the POR as is. Every line in POR get a record created in “Plan of Records” object in SFDC. 5. SFDC process will read the POR and create POR Summary. The summary defines the offering family, major offering, revenue, margin. 6. Access further detail on the POR on the POR Summary Detail Screen  November 13, 2019 12© 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. SFDC – POR Offering Match (cont.): 7. Based on offering family/major offering match the POR data will be updated into Revenue Schedule and the Revenue Start Date, Term and Financials are updated based on POR into SFDC. The Revenue schedule will have the Type = POR, which will not allow user to Edit. Note: Edits must be made in the Pricing Tools which will then update Salesforce. Changes to products on the Major Sub Offering level or to make updates to Partners and OSS Assignments, should happen directly in Salesforce. November 13, 2019 13© 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. SFDC – POR Offering Match (cont.): 8. DoA will not be impacted on this scenario. 9. A email notification will be sent to Opportunity Owner and Pricer on what data attribute was overridden by POR. 10. There are now two POR types: Interim and Final. When the POR type is “final” the system will validate against the POR sign date = Opportunity Close date. If this matches, the deal can be moved to stage 06 and it is LOCKED and cannot be changes. Note: To change a locked POR, the Booking Validation Team must reject the POR and reject the Booking Validation in Salesforce. Sample email: © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved.

All rights reserved. How is the Opportunity Owner Impacted? • For late stage deals, no need to manage the Product information in SFDC. It will be loaded from the POR • Changes to the deal scope (products/financials) should be made in the Pricing tool. The POR generated by the Pricing tool will be fed to SFDC • Review the email messages when the POR load occurs. It will show you what was in SFDC and is in the POR • Make sure your Products in SFDC match the products you are entering in the Pricing tool. This will ensure you have no issues when you have the first POR load into SFDC • POR’s only go down to the Major Offering level. If you are using Major Sub-Offerings in your deal, SFDC will save the Major Sub-Offerings but you will need to allocate the revenue across the Major Sub-Offerings • OSS and Partner assignments are made at the product level. If the POR has different products, you may be asked to select new partners for these new offerings. The OSS assignment will be retained when there is a POR/SFDC match. If the POR and SFDC offerings do not match, the OSS assignment maybe lost. Please make sure to check the OSS assignments if you have received a POR/SFDC mis-match email • Make sure your “Lead Offering” for your DoA is accurate. If the deal is already DoA approved and if the offering changes due to POR load the final gate approval will be reset and opportunity owner has to redo the final governance gate • No need to upload the POR when going through the validation process © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

Opportunity owner (or) Pricer creates Interim POR in pricing tool. 3. The Interim POR (Reporting) flows into MIDAS and reaches SFDC via NIFI Integrator. 4. The SFDC consumes the POR as is. Every line in POR get a record created in “Plan of Records” object in SFDC. 5. SFDC process will read the POR and create POR Summary.

All rights reserved. SFDC – POR Offering Match (cont.): 7. Based on offering family/major offering match the POR data will be updated into Revenue Schedule and the Revenue Start Date, Term and Financials are updated based on POR into SFDC. The Revenue schedule will have the Type = POR, which will not allow user to Edit. Note: Edits must be made in the Pricing Tools which will then update Salesforce. Changes to products on the Major Sub Offering level or to make updates to Partners and OSS Assignments, should happen directly in Salesforce. November 13, 2019 13© 2019 DXC Technology Company.

A email notification will be sent to Opportunity Owner and Pricer on what data attribute was overridden by POR. 10. There are now two POR types: Interim and Final. When the POR type is “final” the system will validate against the POR sign date = Opportunity Close date. If this matches, the deal can be moved to stage 06 and it is LOCKED and cannot be changes.

Well – what happens if you start putting structure behind this new IT Service Delivery Model and we get in front of the challenges of the Multisupplier environment? Because we still have the same challenges – they don’t go away… What happens is that we turn those challenges into opportunities… We start decreasing our cost structure and increasing the overall performance of IT service delivery, while improving end-user satisfaction We begin managing the delivery of IT services seamlessly regardless of technical domains and service providers and even geographies We increase the overall quality of the IT infrastructure and environment; helping to speed the introduce of new services And Ultimately, we make “IT delivery” invisible to the end-user – it becomes something that is there for them – whenever, wherever they need it. At that point – the CIO and IT organization starts moving from a “cost” center to an innovation and solution center – and that’s where you want to be.

COBOL, JCLs, assembler and DB2 were migrated resulting in operational cost savings and performance improvements to batch jobs & CICS transaction response times. Rearchitect of three mainframe applications to Java on Windows using BluAge Velocity. Improved performance, maintainability and cost savings as a result of this transformation. Additionally, the DB2 database was migrated to SQL Server and batch jobs to Universal Controller. Modernization of a large business critical COBOL PACBASE membership system to JEE architecture using Blu Age. New features were added to the membership system by managing their UML2 models and then regenerating the JEE code. Transformation of a cards & payments mainframe application was done one component at a time to microservices based architecture. Responsive UI with ASP.NET & HTML5.

All rights reserved. PD_1317a-20 Up to 30% reduction in IT outsourcing costs As we wrap up – remember those challenges we mentioned at the beginning of this presentation? Well – what happens if you start putting structure behind this new IT Service Delivery Model and we get in front of the challenges of the Multisupplier environment? Because we still have the same challenges – they don’t go away… What happens is that we turn those challenges into opportunities… We start decreasing our cost structure and increasing the overall performance of IT service delivery, while improving end-user satisfaction We begin managing the delivery of IT services seamlessly regardless of technical domains and service providers and even geographies We increase the overall quality of the IT infrastructure and environment; helping to speed the introduce of new services And Ultimately, we make “IT delivery” invisible to the end-user – it becomes something that is there for them – whenever, wherever they need it. At that point – the CIO and IT organization starts moving from a “cost” center to an innovation and solution center – and that’s where you want to be.

COBOL, JCLs, assembler and DB2 were migrated resulting in operational cost savings and performance improvements to batch jobs & CICS transaction response times. Rearchitect of three mainframe applications to Java on Windows using BluAge Velocity. Improved performance, maintainability and cost savings as a result of this transformation. Additionally, the DB2 database was migrated to SQL Server and batch jobs to Universal Controller. Modernization of a large business critical COBOL PACBASE membership system to JEE architecture using Blu Age. New features were added to the membership system by managing their UML2 models and then regenerating the JEE code. Transformation of a cards & payments mainframe application was done one component at a time to microservices based architecture. Responsive UI with ASP.NET & HTML5. Business logic is managed via a RESTful API based on Spring Boot & Java with JSON. Automated CI / CD pipeline integrated with Github Enterprise.

I am both excited and confident that this new focused strategy will enable us to better serve customer needs and grow in the IT Services market. Going forward, DXC will be focused on helping our customers across the entire enterprise technology stack with differentiated industry solutions. The enterprise technology stack includes ITO; Cloud and Security Services; Applications and Industry IP; Data, Analytics, and Engineering Services; and Advisory. We will be reinvesting in our business to operate more effectively and better serve our customers and our people. Core to this new strategy is a reemphasis on our ITO business, which is critical for our customers – and when done well, gives them the confidence to turn to us when additional IT services are required. Today we also communicated that we will seek strategic alternatives for three businesses: Workplace and Mobility, U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services, and Horizontal BPS. These are the only businesses that will be under review. They each are market leading, however they are adjacent to our focused strategy. Throughout this process we will remain closely engaged with our customers to ensure we are delivering on our commitments. The reemphasis in our ITO business aligns well with what we have heard from our customers and will make DXC an even stronger partner for those who require capabilities across the enterprise technology stack. I will be reaching out to you to share more details about our new strategy. Please feel free to be in touch in the meantime with any questions. Thank you for your continued support of DXC.

C A foundation built on core values Teamwork Leadership should derive from skill, not title; our CLEAR Values align teammates from/across all layers and levels Immediacy of Media/News With little time to get it right, an employee’s first instinct should be informed by our CLEAR Values Virtual Workers Our CLEAR Values represent common standards that unite a global, increasingly virtual DXC community Diversity and Globalization Our CLEAR Values smooth otherwise obvious differences in age, gender, religion and custom/heritage Rising Use of Strategic Partners Our CLEAR Values drive uniformity in our dealings with customers, suppliers and competitors Entrepreneurship With encouragement for risk-taking and innovation comes the need to act responsibly and with integrity      November 12, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. DXC Technology’s CLEAR Values are an important competitive differentiator and intangible driver of our company’s success. They define all we do and who we are; our CLEAR Values are the distinguishing hallmarks of DXC performance and reputation. DXC clients and business partners the world over know that our leaders have long committed to a strong culture of ethics and performance with integrity — a culture in which the way we achieve our objectives and conduct ourselves matters as much as, if not more than, the results. Consequently, ours is a proud heritage marked by the experience of clients and partners who, over many years and through thick and thin, can point to circumstances in which the commitment of our teams to integrity and values was a reassuring difference-maker that deepened trust and, occasionally, restored confidence. So, we know from real experience that values-driven performance with integrity defines our today and secures our tomorrow. In many ways, the CLEAR Values are the “special sauce” of DXC. We depend on our values to harmonize interactions with each other and among our clients, business partners, and competitors. The CLEAR Values unify us in all organizations and worksites, and link us as one, whether we’re physically co-located or members of virtual teams. As well, our CLEAR Values align us to objectives as effective teammates without regard for titles or differences in workplace responsibility. Also important is the effect our values have on decision-making and personal responsibility. We trust our CLEAR Values to inform employee instincts in fast-moving circumstances when there’s little time to “get it right.” Likewise, they ground our actions in responsibility and integrity when risk taking and innovation are required. Indeed, we believe decisions and actions taken consistent with our CLEAR Values are time and again the right decisions, and always good business. At DXC, integrity, culture, and these CLEAR Values will remain vitally important to us. Our people know there are not any circumstances in which it is appropriate to abandon these ideals. We believe they drive an enduring confidence and trust that secures our industry leadership. So, we embrace a culture of integrity and these CLEAR Values with a mind to far exceed minimal compliance standards, always and everywhere. At DXC Technology, we expect and accept nothing less. 15 About DXC Technology DXC Technology, the world’s leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, manages and modernizes mission-critical systems, integrating them with new digital solutions to produce better business outcomes.

If we do a fixed price engagement for say $200,000 thinking that will cover 100 FTE-days at $2,000 per day and end up spending 200 days on the project we have effectively given a 50% discount on our work. The way you need to structure a professional services engagement is first to engage the Professional Services team so they can scope the work and line out who will do the work (typically three different resource types). The scope of work, times the daily rate for each resource type becomes an estimate for the project. That estimate is basically a time and material bid and should be inserted in the SOW. We can put parameters (approved by PS and Sales team Leader) around that estimate without hurting our VSOE stance such as: a) any work beyond the estimate will require a change order to be executed by the parties or b) if actual work goes beyond 10%, then the parties will execute a change order. Blending DXC Agility Platform into other offerings – DXC Agility Platform is a distinct service offering. [Note: deleted text here] Every DXC Agility Platform deal needs to have an Agility Platform order, Maintenance Agreement and an end-user license (or the contractual equivalent) regardless if it is a stand-alone sale or sold in conjunction with any other DXC offering. If a DXC account team wants to use DXC Agility Platform to manage a Client’s compute environment and fold the cost into the VM fees, it requires Offering and Contracts/Legal approval. Selling Agility Platform to account teams at cost – This cannot be done without L3 approval. Doing so would cause two problems. First, it will impact revenue recognition on the internal sale. Rather, sales to DXC account teams should follow standard contracting processes consistent with this policy to support VSOE. And second, we lose our ability to demonstrate the value of DXC Agility Platform to “the street” by reporting growth in DXC Agility Platform revenues. Maintenance discounting - Clients can purchase platinum maintenance and support for 25% of the license cost. When a deal approaches 500 VM Licenses, platinum maintenance and support can be discounted, with L3 approval, down to an effective rate of 20%. Platinum maintenance discounts greater than 20% require L2 approval. • Maintenance pricing for VSOE: Technical Accounting must be consulted on any negotiation where the renewal rate for maintenance is below 18% or above 27% of license fee. This is because VSOE of maintenance is presently based on a target price of 22.5% of license fee, which allows for pricing within +/- 20% of this target rate. Pricing below the low range of 18% on any contract will disallow up front revenue recognition for that contract and should be avoided. Pricing above the 27% high range can be supported, but should be infrequent. Maintenance Term – one year term on all maintenance agreements with one year renewal periods, even if the term of the contract is longer Maintenance Renewal - Maintenance renewal pricing can increase only based on a relevant inflation index (e.g. CPI). Any other factors such as fixed % increases requires consultation with Technical Accounting.  November 12, 2019 End ",

If we do a fixed price engagement for say $200,000 thinking that will cover 100 FTE-days at $2,000 per day and end up spending 200 days on the project we have effectively given a 50% discount on our work. The way you need to structure a professional services engagement is first to engage the Professional Services team so they can scope the work and line out who will do the work (typically three different resource types). The scope of work, times the daily rate for each resource type becomes an estimate for the project. That estimate is basically a time and material bid and should be inserted in the SOW. We can put parameters (approved by PS and Sales team Leader) around that estimate without hurting our VSOE stance such as: a) any work beyond the estimate will require a change order to be executed by the parties or b) if actual work goes beyond 10%, then the parties will execute a change order. Blending DXC Agility Platform into other offerings – DXC Agility Platform is a distinct service offering. [Note: deleted text here] Every DXC Agility Platform deal needs to have an Agility Platform order, Maintenance Agreement and an end-user license (or the contractual equivalent) regardless if it is a stand-alone sale or sold in conjunction with any other DXC offering. If a DXC account team wants to use DXC Agility Platform to manage a Client’s compute environment and fold the cost into the VM fees, it requires Offering and Contracts/Legal approval. Selling Agility Platform to account teams at cost – This cannot be done without L3 approval. Doing so would cause two problems. First, it will impact revenue recognition on the internal sale. Rather, sales to DXC account teams should follow standard contracting processes consistent with this policy to support VSOE. And second, we lose our ability to demonstrate the value of DXC Agility Platform to “the street” by reporting growth in DXC Agility Platform revenues. Maintenance discounting - Clients can purchase platinum maintenance and support for 25% of the license cost. When a deal approaches 500 VM Licenses, platinum maintenance and support can be discounted, with L3 approval, down to an effective rate of 20%. Platinum maintenance discounts greater than 20% require L2 approval. • Maintenance pricing for VSOE: Technical Accounting must be consulted on any negotiation where the renewal rate for maintenance is below 18% or above 27% of license fee. This is because VSOE of maintenance is presently based on a target price of 22.5% of license fee, which allows for pricing within +/- 20% of this target rate. Pricing below the low range of 18% on any contract will disallow up front revenue recognition for that contract and should be avoided. Pricing above the 27% high range can be supported, but should be infrequent. Maintenance Term – one year term on all maintenance agreements with one year renewal periods, even if the term of the contract is longer Maintenance Renewal - Maintenance renewal pricing can increase only based on a relevant inflation index (e.g. CPI). Any other factors such as fixed % increases requires consultation with Technical Accounting.  November 12, 2019 End ",

I am both excited and confident that this new focused strategy will enable us to better serve your needs and grow in the IT Services market. Going forward, DXC will be focused on helping our customers across the entire enterprise technology stack with differentiated industry solutions. The enterprise technology stack includes ITO; Cloud and Security Services; Applications and Industry IP; Data, Analytics and Engineering Services; and Advisory. We will be reinvesting in our business to operate more effectively and better serve our customers and our people. Core to this new strategy is a reemphasis on our ITO business, which is critical for our customers – and when done well, gives them the confidence to turn to us when additional IT services are required. Today we also communicated that we will seek strategic alternatives for three businesses: Workplace and Mobility, U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services, and Horizontal BPS. These are the only businesses that will be under review. They each are market leading, however they are adjacent to our focused strategy. Throughout this process we will remain closely engaged with our customers to ensure we are delivering on our commitments. The reemphasis on our ITO business aligns well with what we have heard from our customers and will make DXC an even stronger partner for those who require capabilities across the enterprise technology stack.

Customers: Upgrade engagement and service for key accounts Deliver against customer priorities 2. People: Invest in our people/employee value proposition Augment senior management team (5 key additions already) Expand account management and sales talent 3. Operational Execution: Invest in and enhance delivery execution Simplify operating model Re-emphasize the ITO business Execute go-forward strategy centered on: Enterprise technology stack Selling industry solutions Focus on installed base of customers Pursue strategic alternatives for adjacent businesses that do not fit the strategy Pursue a balanced capital allocation Maintain investment grade credit profile Priorities Running the Business Unlock Value  November 11, 2019 ‹#› 2nd Quarter FY 2020 Earnings Presentation We believe there is an exciting path forward to run the business more effectively while also unlocking value On the left side, running the business involves a stronger focus on customers, people, and operational execution On customers, we will invest to stabilize key accounts and assure that our delivery is meeting our customers’ expectations. Doing this will ensure that we earn “the right to walk the halls” and help them with additional work as they think through their strategies On people, we will make investments to acknowledge, recognize, and reward our people, which will strengthen our employee value proposition. As I just discussed, we have started adding outstanding talent to our DXC leadership team and we will be adding to this team in the areas of account management, sales, and delivery On operational execution, we will invest to enhance delivery execution. We will simplify the way we work together to drive increased accountability. Going forward, we will also re-emphasize our ITO business, which is critical to our success On the right side, unlocking value includes a clear outlook, execution of a new strategy, as well as evaluating strategic alternatives We will execute a focused strategy around the enterprise technology stack, selling industry solutions, and focusing on our existing customers We will be pursuing strategic alternatives for three businesses that do not fit our focused strategy. These businesses comprise roughly 25% of our current revenue Additionally, we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach while maintaining our investment grade credit profile 2  DXC strategy moving forward DXC is running mission-critical systems – our customers expect silent operations Customers need to upgrade these mission-critical systems and want to partner with someone they trust However, not all workloads will move to cloud – our large customers typically have a hybrid environment with a mix of on-premise as well as private and public cloud Security is a top concern for our customers, and they expect us to have deep capabilities Service providers with end-to-end capabilities have an opportunity to grow with these customers as they scale their digital capabilities Leveraging analytics for business insights is becoming a key priority for our customers Customer expectations Implications: Significant opportunity with customers by leveraging core capabilities and reinvesting in customers, talent, and operational excellence Enterprise technology stack  November 11, 2019 ‹#› 2nd Quarter FY 2020 Earnings Presentation Going forward, DXC will run as one company focused on the enterprise technology stack vs. a traditional business and a digital business. Customers will see 1 DXC not 2. To the left of this slide is what we refer to as the enterprise technology stack The enterprise technology stack mimics the strategic thinking of how our customers view their technology journey and starts with ITO. That is the foundation, and DXC has an installed base that is second to none. The next level includes cloud with security services, which reflects the fact that customers are buying those services bundled Moving up the stack, the applications layer is critical, where we rationalize, modernize and manage customer workloads Then we can leverage analytics capabilities to harvest data and ultimately provide engineering services to generate business insights for our customers We cannot deliver the technology stack on its own. We have to also provide deep industry expertise. We will do this by providing integrated industry solutions to our customers Let us also share with you the feedback we have heard from our customers, which is to the right of this slide DXC runs mission-critical systems and operations for our customers. They expect these to be run silently and effectively Many of our customers need to upgrade these systems, and they want to partner with someone they trust. This trust requires a deep understanding of their environments with demonstrated experience executing at scale Also, our customers recognize that not all of their workloads are going to migrate to the cloud. They need a provider who can support on-premise assets as well as private and public cloud environments Security is a top concern, and customers expect us to bring deep expertise to them in this area Our customers are looking to scale their digital capabilities that includes analytics that produce business insights and they want to grow with service providers who have scale Overall, the key message is that DXC is missing opportunities with our customers. We need to show visible reinvestment to strengthen customer confidence, capture these opportunities moving forward, and position DXC for growth 3  Note: Data, Analytics, and Eng. Svcs. includes Luxoft revenues annualized for 12 months GIS: $10.5B includes Cloud and Security Services, ITO, and Workplace and Mobility GBS: $9.5B includes Advisory, Data, Analytics & Eng. Services, Applications/ Industry IP, U.S. State & Local HHS, and Horizontal BPS DXC has capabilities at scale across the stack Strategic alternatives ~25% of total DXC revenue Workplace and Mobility Horizontal BPS U.S. State & Local HHS $1.4B $0.7B $2.9B Importance to technology stack Ability to create industry solutions What customers want Potential to unlock value Guiding principles $0.5B $1.4B $5.4B $2.1B $5.4B  November 11, 2019 ‹#› 2nd Quarter FY 2020 Earnings Presentation We’ve conducted a review of our portfolio to understand how well DXC’s current businesses align against the enterprise technology stack and our focused strategy First, DXC has capabilities at scale against each layer of the enterprise technology stack. We have $5.4 billion in ITO revenue, $2.1 billion in Cloud and Security, $5.4 billion in Applications and Industry IP, and $1.4 billion in Data Analytics and Engineering Services, including the Luxoft business, and roughly $500M of Advisory revenue Next, let’s discuss the outcome of the review of DXC’s current businesses We evaluated each of our businesses against the following criteria: 1. the importance to the enterprise technology stack, 2. the ability to create industry solutions, 3. what customers wanted, and 4. the potential to unlock value Out of that analysis, we decided to pursue strategic alternatives for three businesses, the U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services business, our Horizontal BPS business, and our Workplace and Mobility business. Combined, these businesses represent about 25% of DXC’s total revenue These are strong businesses. Our Workplace and Mobility and our U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services businesses are market leaders, and we also have meaningful IP in our Horizontal BPS business When we say strategic alternatives, that could involve a range of actions to unlock value including potential divestitures to strategic or financial buyers, a spin-off, or other transactions Throughout this process, we will remain closely engaged with our customers and our people ensuring we are meeting our commitments to both 4  DXC is well positioned to grow DXC has significant scale and scope, along with mission-critical positions at large customers DXC has reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost-efficient boosts competitiveness Customers are facing transformation challenges across the entire enterprise technology stack. They need DXC to help them modernize their IT, optimize data architectures, and securely orchestrate all of it across public, private, and hybrid clouds   November 11, 2019 ‹#› 2nd Quarter FY 2020 Earnings Presentation We are excited to be at DXC at this moment. It is clear that DXC has a unique opportunity, thanks to three factors: 1. DXC has significant scope and scale, along with mission-critical positions at large customers 2. DXC in recent history has reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost efficient boosts your ability to compete 3. Customers are facing transformation challenges across the enterprise technology stack, and they are in need of DXC’s deep ITO capabilities and experience. Customers need a partner like DXC to help them modernize their ITO layer, optimize their data architectures, and make it all secure and orchestrated across public, private, and hybrid clouds This will now be the main thrust in DXC’s focused strategy -- to leverage our ITO expertise to help customers across the enterprise technology stack We’re equipped with a much-improved cost structure. And we're going to raise the bar by investing in our people and in our customer service Plus, we're going to move away from businesses that are not core to transforming the enterprise technology stack and focus on the businesses that are integral to our focused strategy and our customers’ needs 5  © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

This trust requires a deep understanding of their environments with demonstrated experience executing at scale Also, our customers recognize that not all of their workloads are going to migrate to the cloud. They need a provider who can support on-premise assets as well as private and public cloud environments Security is a top concern, and customers expect us to bring deep expertise to them in this area Our customers are looking to scale their digital capabilities that includes analytics that produce business insights and they want to grow with service providers who have scale Overall, the key message is that DXC is missing opportunities with our customers. We need to show visible reinvestment to strengthen customer confidence, capture these opportunities moving forward, and position DXC for growth 3  Note: Data, Analytics, and Eng.

We have $5.4 billion in ITO revenue, $2.1 billion in Cloud and Security, $5.4 billion in Applications and Industry IP, and $1.4 billion in Data Analytics and Engineering Services, including the Luxoft business, and roughly $500M of Advisory revenue Next, let’s discuss the outcome of the review of DXC’s current businesses We evaluated each of our businesses against the following criteria: 1. the importance to the enterprise technology stack, 2. the ability to create industry solutions, 3. what customers wanted, and 4. the potential to unlock value Out of that analysis, we decided to pursue strategic alternatives for three businesses, the U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services business, our Horizontal BPS business, and our Workplace and Mobility business. Combined, these businesses represent about 25% of DXC’s total revenue These are strong businesses. Our Workplace and Mobility and our U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services businesses are market leaders, and we also have meaningful IP in our Horizontal BPS business When we say strategic alternatives, that could involve a range of actions to unlock value including potential divestitures to strategic or financial buyers, a spin-off, or other transactions Throughout this process, we will remain closely engaged with our customers and our people ensuring we are meeting our commitments to both 4  DXC is well positioned to grow DXC has significant scale and scope, along with mission-critical positions at large customers DXC has reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost-efficient boosts competitiveness Customers are facing transformation challenges across the entire enterprise technology stack. They need DXC to help them modernize their IT, optimize data architectures, and securely orchestrate all of it across public, private, and hybrid clouds   November 11, 2019 ‹#› 2nd Quarter FY 2020 Earnings Presentation We are excited to be at DXC at this moment. It is clear that DXC has a unique opportunity, thanks to three factors: 1. DXC has significant scope and scale, along with mission-critical positions at large customers 2. DXC in recent history has reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost efficient boosts your ability to compete 3. Customers are facing transformation challenges across the enterprise technology stack, and they are in need of DXC’s deep ITO capabilities and experience. Customers need a partner like DXC to help them modernize their ITO layer, optimize their data architectures, and make it all secure and orchestrated across public, private, and hybrid clouds This will now be the main thrust in DXC’s focused strategy -- to leverage our ITO expertise to help customers across the enterprise technology stack We’re equipped with a much-improved cost structure. And we're going to raise the bar by investing in our people and in our customer service Plus, we're going to move away from businesses that are not core to transforming the enterprise technology stack and focus on the businesses that are integral to our focused strategy and our customers’ needs 5  © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

Jacobson, H. (N.D). Your Key Differentiator. Retrieved from: http://www.howieconnect.com/Key%20Differentiator.pdf Top 5 reasons to choose DXC differentiator guideline Economist and Harvard graduate Edward Chamberlin coined the term “product differentiation” in the 1930s. A differentiator represents a unique business characteristic that distinguishes it from the competition. However, finding meaningful differences is very difficult because many competitors offer very similar service offerings. While summarizing the best facts, quotes, and statistics is a good start, this material may not be convincing enough. Chamberlin, E. (2012, July 6). Key Differentiator(s)–What’s Yours? Retrieved from: http://www.smartmarketingllc.com/2012/07/06/key-differentiators-whats-yours/ A key differentiator should be true, unique, valuable, measurable and defendable. It should go beyond what a client already expects, example: good value, fair prices and/or excellent client service. It should make a client want to select DXC as a vendor over the competition.

It comprises of an end-to-end suite of industry-leading front-office customer experience solutions that are optimized for machine learning, Internet of Things and blockchain, to empower enterprises to innovate and transform at a rapid pace.

Comprehensive: SAP C/4HANA replaces point solutions with a framework that gives customers a complete solution across Commerce, Marketing, Sales, Service, and Customer Data management to drive their customer engagement across all channels and touch points – from web and mobile to in-store, contact center, and in the hands of sales reps. Consistent: C/4HANA connects customers and consumers to companies in ways that reflect the changing nature of engagement. It addresses the convergence of the physical and digital worlds that customers experience when interacting with their favorite brands and brings consistency to the customer experience. For businesses this means a single consistent view of their customers and for customers a consistent assortment, promotions, policies, and interactions that can be delivered contextually. Only SAP can enable the end-customer to have a single view of the business and the business to have a single view of the customer. Contextual: C/4HANA enables companies to serve customers contextually across their marketing, commerce, sales, and service interactions. The experience on a mobile device should not be the same as in-store, on the web, or when a customer calls. Context matters to drive the optimum experience for the customer from how they are marketed to and through their buying journey across multiple physical and digital touch-points. Customers today expect self-service interactions that know who they are and how best to serve them, and digitally enabled service and sales people who can use that same power to better serve them.

CP_1349c-20 Our approach differentiates from our competitors by: As co-developers of C/4HANA accelerators and offerings, we pride ourselves on our deep knowledge of the C/4HANA suite that can only come from deep development alongside a vendor. This enables us to ensure standard product functionality and configuration is truly exhausted before customization is incorporated to deliver a solution. Additionally, DXC ICX’s approach to delivery of SAP C/4HANA solutions align closely to the SAP Activate approach. Together, this enables us to reduce build complexity, reduce product maintenance complexity, allow the product to be easily upgraded in the future, and reduce delivery timelines and costs. In doing so, we ensure the resulting solution is based on SAP best practices that enable cost-effective scaling and expansion as your needs of the platform grow. Prepare & Explore Phase = Strategy & Discovery A high-level list of all desired requirements and capabilities is produced and prioritized in a Prioritized Requirements List (PRL) as user stories Realize & Deploy Phase = Build Delivered using the Agile method. This ensures the scope of what is to be delivered to be unambiguous and measurable, enabling work to be tested and accepted iteratively. As with all Agile delivery frameworks, change during the delivery process is inevitable and as with any change, risk is present. Therefore, throughout the process, we ensure we mitigate risk with robust Governance and Reporting employing flexible scope management and formal change control processes to minimize impact to deliverables. Hypercare = Support (2 weeks post launch Post-Go-Live Support) Following Go-Live, we provide Hypercare support, typically for a period of 2 weeks. The terms and duration of this support will be agreed with the Customer in the Solution Pack. This support will cover: 1. Monitor the deployed application(s). 2. Stabilize deployed applications as required. 3. Resolve Priority 1, Priority 2, and Priority 3 issues Run Phase = Support: If ongoing support is sought, this can also be made available. This will require a separate Run SoW and focuses on keeping the system available and performing at the high levels required to support business operations. During the Run phase, the live system may be assessed to identify opportunities to further optimize the system by applying additional standards. 18 Strategy Customer Business Technology Map Current State Ideate Future State Evaluate Options Define Roadmap Client strategy Audience data analysis Organization charts Customer journey Current state architecture map Competitor analysis Pain points Capability reviews Key process reviews Metrics Policies and procedures Customer journey Roles and responsibilities Talent requirements Possible solutions Future objectives Functional capabilities Revised metrics Policies and procedures Future state architecture map Data requirements Business viability Business case Customer feedback Customer satisfaction Address quick wins Define point of differentiation Define actionable goals Define channels Define customer success metrics Technology feasibility Integration requirements Define point of differentiation Define actionable goals Define business success metrics Define build priorities October 11, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

Jacobson, H. (N.D). Your Key Differentiator. Retrieved from: http://www.howieconnect.com/Key%20Differentiator.pdf Top 5 reasons to choose DXC differentiator guideline Economist and Harvard graduate Edward Chamberlin coined the term “product differentiation” in the 1930s. A differentiator represents a unique business characteristic that distinguishes it from the competition. However, finding meaningful differences is very difficult because many competitors offer very similar service offerings. While summarizing the best facts, quotes, and statistics is a good start, this material may not be convincing enough. Chamberlin, E. (2012, July 6). Key Differentiator(s)–What’s Yours? Retrieved from: http://www.smartmarketingllc.com/2012/07/06/key-differentiators-whats-yours/ A key differentiator should be true, unique, valuable, measurable and defendable. It should go beyond what a client already expects, example: good value, fair prices and/or excellent client service. It should make a client want to select DXC as a vendor over the competition.

CP_1349c-20 A popular customer experience billed as personalized generally begins with a customer's initial awareness of a product, company, experience, or service etc. that could be through any conceivable channel, be it [CLICK] mobile, [CLICK] social, [CLICK] online search etc. [CLICK] Different applications are then used to capture data from these interactions to determine the best way to engage with the customer [CLICK] through automated responses such as email or by notifying a representative to call directly. Along the way, data about each individual is collected to build profiles of a customer and [CLICK] teams of people analyze the unique paths of each customer. The analysis allows the your sales or marketing teams to [CLICK] optimize the next engagement cycle for your customer base. The process can become investment heavy as you optimize for every conceivable engagement possibility - [CLICK] Opening and preparing new channels with speed to market in mind will require [CLICK] adding new technologies to overcome limitations that were previously unknown at time of initial implementation [CLICK] which then require the need to implement new business processes and training for people to deliver with the increased applications that require administration and management resources, possibly taking away the time required to ultimately optimize your engagement cycles, which was why you wanted to digitally transform in the first place. That is just one scenario but can vary immensely within each industry. At DXC, we acknowledge the unique challenges of each individual industry. By accounting for these unique [CLICK] industry challenges, a customer’s instinctive expectations of a seamless experience can be designed. Logical next steps can be pre-determined by, and delivered with, [CLICK] the latest technologies (such as IOT), and through this intelligence, further enhancements can be made to [CLICK] business processes specific to industry. Finally, with the intelligence collected, analyzed and findings produced, [CLICK] will empower the people of your organizations to stay one step ahead of the customer, ensuring an experience that feels organic and unique(ly personalized) to the individual.. 15 Our practice: the challenges we solve Client Organization Customers Suppliers SAP C/4HANA SAP Core Front Office (where customers directly engage)      Back Office    October 11, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

All rights reserved. CP_1349c-20 To deliver this, ICX leverages the power of SAP C/4HANA, a unified omni-channel cloud platform and suite of solutions that is open, modular and extensible. It comprises of an end-to-end suite of industry-leading front-office customer experience solutions that are optimized for machine learning, Internet of Things and blockchain, to empower enterprises to innovate and transform at a rapid pace. Underpinning this technology is a unified customer data that progressively builds a unified customer profile enabling the delivery of consistent and personalized experiences at each customer engagement and touchpoint throughout their journey from awareness to nurture, purchase to service and beyond. Comprehensive: SAP C/4HANA replaces point solutions with a framework that gives customers a complete solution across Commerce, Marketing, Sales, Service, and Customer Data management to drive their customer engagement across all channels and touch points – from web and mobile to in-store, contact center, and in the hands of sales reps. Consistent: C/4HANA connects customers and consumers to companies in ways that reflect the changing nature of engagement. It addresses the convergence of the physical and digital worlds that customers experience when interacting with their favorite brands and brings consistency to the customer experience. For businesses this means a single consistent view of their customers and for customers a consistent assortment, promotions, policies, and interactions that can be delivered contextually. Only SAP can enable the end-customer to have a single view of the business and the business to have a single view of the customer. Contextual: C/4HANA enables companies to serve customers contextually across their marketing, commerce, sales, and service interactions. The experience on a mobile device should not be the same as in-store, on the web, or when a customer calls. Context matters to drive the optimum experience for the customer from how they are marketed to and through their buying journey across multiple physical and digital touch-points. Customers today expect self-service interactions that know who they are and how best to serve them, and digitally enabled service and sales people who can use that same power to better serve them. Contemporary, agile, & open: SAP enables companies to differentiate, extend the solution, and adapt to the changing customer and marketplace by leveraging C/4HANA to deliver Commerce Cloud, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Customer Data Cloud solutions to support the full omni-channel capabilities required by businesses today. Partner solutions, such as Adobe, compliment and add value to meet specific needs of customers across diverse geographies and verticals. Solution Notes: SAP C/4HANA is the technology foundation by which DXC delivers a market-defining omni-channel customer experience solution. The SAP C/4HANA suite comprises of Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Customer Data Cloud. The products in the portfolio work independently and together as an end-to-end integrated suite of industry-leading solutions, enabling a unified cloud platform that is open, modular and extensible. The suite is optimized for machine learning, Internet of Things and blockchain, and designed to be agile, flexible and scalable, empowering enterprises to innovate and transform at a rapid pace. Underpinning this technology is a unified customer data that progressively builds a unified customer profile enabling the delivery of consistent and personalized experiences at each customer engagement and touchpoint throughout their journey with a business, from awareness to nurture, purchase to service, and beyond. SAP Commerce Cloud is a robust modular and extensible framework designed to support businesses in delivering end-to-end omni-channel commerce processes, including cart checkout, product content and experience management, promotions, and order management, to achieve seamless integration and interaction with components built natively on the same platform. The solution supports all go-to-market models and accelerates time-to-value with pre-built templated instances (Accelerators) for B2B, B2C, B2B2C, and industry-specific capabilities. SAP Marketing Cloud solutions deliver intelligent enterprise marketing solutions to help organizations develop dynamic, trusted customer profiles, gain deep insights into performance, and optimize marketing in the moment while orchestrating the best-run, end-to-end customer experiences. Organizations can orchestrate individualized brand experiences across channels and departments (powered by machine learning) and empower teams to make data-driven decisions with centralized performance management and greater process transparency. SAP Service Cloud reduces call center operations, increases the efficiency of field service reps, and improves customer and employee satisfaction. The solution drives a unified service experience by drawing upon a single view of the customer and enabling all service individuals to a gain the insight they need to provide the relevant service. Agents and technicians are empowered to self-serve and can leverage intelligent technologies such as AI to provide faster and more accurate answers. SAP Sales Cloud gives sales the skills, tools, knowledge, and data they need to sell more, faster. The solution empowers sales by providing a complete view of every customer and every opportunity to provide the business transparency of sales pipeline health, more accurate forecasting with reporting and thereby improve sales strategy. The solution continues the omni-channel capabilities of the suite with mobile online and offline capabilities. The solution also enables digital quotes and contracts with seamless, automated and intelligent configurations. SAP Customer Cloud enables organizations to manage data protection and privacy. It comprises of Customer Identity, Customer Consent, and Customer Profile. Customer Identity enables the business to identify and engage customers across channels and devices with seamless and secure access through registration and social authentication screens and flows that are customizable for particular business cases. Customer Consent is ideal for responding to data privacy regulations and consumer concerns. It enables customers to have control of their own profile information and preferences for communications and marketing activities. Customer Profile enables the elimination of data silos to drive better contextual marketing by unifying customer identities, profile attributes and online activity digital technology stack. 17 Delivery approach How we do it What we do We are human centered and put people first We listen to the customer and design for the future We focus on relationships not transactions People focused Business driven Technology enabled  Strategy Discovery Build Support    Map Current State Ideate Future State Evaluate Options Define Roadmap Understand Ideate Define Test Design Engineer QA Launch Monitor Restore Observe Maintain Improve October 11, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company. All rights reserved. CP_1349c-20 Our approach differentiates from our competitors by: As co-developers of C/4HANA accelerators and offerings, we pride ourselves on our deep knowledge of the C/4HANA suite that can only come from deep development alongside a vendor. This enables us to ensure standard product functionality and configuration is truly exhausted before customization is incorporated to deliver a solution. Additionally, DXC ICX’s approach to delivery of SAP C/4HANA solutions align closely to the SAP Activate approach. Together, this enables us to reduce build complexity, reduce product maintenance complexity, allow the product to be easily upgraded in the future, and reduce delivery timelines and costs. In doing so, we ensure the resulting solution is based on SAP best practices that enable cost-effective scaling and expansion as your needs of the platform grow. Prepare & Explore Phase = Strategy & Discovery A high-level list of all desired requirements and capabilities is produced and prioritized in a Prioritized Requirements List (PRL) as user stories Realize & Deploy Phase = Build Delivered using the Agile method. This ensures the scope of what is to be delivered to be unambiguous and measurable, enabling work to be tested and accepted iteratively. As with all Agile delivery frameworks, change during the delivery process is inevitable and as with any change, risk is present. Therefore, throughout the process, we ensure we mitigate risk with robust Governance and Reporting employing flexible scope management and formal change control processes to minimize impact to deliverables. Hypercare = Support (2 weeks post launch Post-Go-Live Support) Following Go-Live, we provide Hypercare support, typically for a period of 2 weeks. The terms and duration of this support will be agreed with the Customer in the Solution Pack. This support will cover: 1. Monitor the deployed application(s). 2. Stabilize deployed applications as required. 3. Resolve Priority 1, Priority 2, and Priority 3 issues Run Phase = Support: If ongoing support is sought, this can also be made available. This will require a separate Run SoW and focuses on keeping the system available and performing at the high levels required to support business operations. During the Run phase, the live system may be assessed to identify opportunities to further optimize the system by applying additional standards. 18 Strategy Customer Business Technology Map Current State Ideate Future State Evaluate Options Define Roadmap Client strategy Audience data analysis Organization charts Customer journey Current state architecture map Competitor analysis Pain points Capability reviews Key process reviews Metrics Policies and procedures Customer journey Roles and responsibilities Talent requirements Possible solutions Future objectives Functional capabilities Revised metrics Policies and procedures Future state architecture map Data requirements Business viability Business case Customer feedback Customer satisfaction Address quick wins Define point of differentiation Define actionable goals Define channels Define customer success metrics Technology feasibility Integration requirements Define point of differentiation Define actionable goals Define business success metrics Define build priorities October 11, 2019 ‹#› © 2019 DXC Technology Company.

Elevator pitch The rush to transition from ownership-based business models to subscription-based models is impacting every industry in every market. Customers are moving to subscription-based services over perpetual buying because it gives control and flexibility of demand-based purchasing, requires smaller up-front investments, yields more transparent pricing and reduces total costs. Gartner has predicted that by the year 2020, 80% of all vendors will offer subscription-based business models. DXC helps organizations transform monetization-related business processes, thereby leading to reduced costs and increased revenue opportunities by reaching new markets. Moving away from the traditional process of selling products and toward selling subscriptions and services gives companies the agility to rapidly expand and adjust into new market and geographies, create consumption-based models that encompass the entire order-to-cash process, and integrate front and back-office systems to meet future digital customer demands. With DXC’s unique delivery approach, our solution can be implemented quickly and cost effectively for organizations to realize benefits sooner. 1 1 5 Wins & Competition 6 Industries 7 More Good Stuff1 What’s Inside 2 Level Setting 3 Approach Plan 4 Partners & Roles 1 DXC Internal Use Only Field leadership team sales guide Value proposition DXC Revenue Solutions for SAP ICX enables organizations to create new recurring revenue process models that give customers purchasing flexibility, and it requires smaller investments and improves the customer experience with SAP BRIM and Subscription Billing applications. DXC’s proven capabilities have demonstrated the following business outcomes: • Process improvement — Implementing SAP BRIM for pricing, rating and charging increased revenue, reduced operating costs and improved customer service for a telecommunications provider. New business processes for subscriptions, usage and revenue sharing promoted enhanced pricing agility to provide mobile, real-time services for a better customer experience. • Increased revenue — By deploying S/4HANA BRIM with SAP Commerce Cloud, a cargo shipping company was able to increase revenue by providing better pricing & service offerings. Additionally, there was improved customer experience gained by offering omni-channel self-service options. • Cost reduction — By integrating SAP BRIM and SAP CRM, a utilities company was able to lower operating costs, significantly reduce revenue leakage and provide more accurate revenue recognition. Challenges / client pain points In the digital economy, organizations are moving away from the traditional process of selling one-time charge products and moving toward selling products, subscriptions and usage-based services. However, organizations are challenged by how to rapidly launch subscription models, adjust to changing markets and create consumption-based processes that encompass the order-to-cash process. Companies investing in business model transformation now have the agility to rapidly expand into new market segments and geographies. They are creating predictable revenue streams, improving product and brand reliability and improving customer lifetime value. Monetizing business model transformation The obstacles and challenges associated with recurring subscription revenue processes are the result of organizations having pricing inflexibility and lacking the ability to scale, capture usage/consumption information or consolidate customer invoices properly. Challenge: A utilities provider required a process for creating ISU postings when the customer no longer had a service contract. This was required as ISU would only generate invoices when a service contract existed. With DXC’s help, implementing SAP Customer Experience Convergent Invoicing (CI) integrated to CRM & B for utilities resulted in consolidated invoices across environments — thereby readily providing invoices to customers without service contracts. Business Outcome • Out-of-the-box integration with ISU for converged revenue management • Automation of end-to-end processes lowered operating costs • Significantly reduced revenue leakage and provided more accurate revenue recognition. Challenge: A cargo shipping company wanted to move from a single-sided to multi-sided business model. By doing so, they were able to shift from fixed pricing to flexible pricing rates and from single communication channels to omni- channel customer engagement. Business Outcome • Deployed SAP S/4HANA BRIM, Convergent Mediation and Commerce Cloud for B2B • Increased revenue by providing right pricing and extending services offerings • Eliminated the potential revenue leakage • Increased customer experience by enabling omni-channel self service Return on investment—how do you measure value? Transforming to remain competitive Organizations that are focused on single customer transactions are losing the opportunities for repeat purchases and for generating predictable revenue streams. Organizations failing to transform in this direction is resulting in declining customer retention and reduced brand loyalty.

New business processes for subscriptions, usage and revenue sharing promoted enhanced pricing agility to provide mobile, real-time services for a better customer experience. • Increased revenue — By deploying S/4HANA BRIM with SAP Commerce Cloud, a cargo shipping company was able to increase revenue by providing better pricing & service offerings. Additionally, there was improved customer experience gained by offering omni-channel self-service options. • Cost reduction — By integrating SAP BRIM and SAP CRM, a utilities company was able to lower operating costs, significantly reduce revenue leakage and provide more accurate revenue recognition. Challenges / client pain points In the digital economy, organizations are moving away from the traditional process of selling one-time charge products and moving toward selling products, subscriptions and usage-based services. However, organizations are challenged by how to rapidly launch subscription models, adjust to changing markets and create consumption-based processes that encompass the order-to-cash process. Companies investing in business model transformation now have the agility to rapidly expand into new market segments and geographies. They are creating predictable revenue streams, improving product and brand reliability and improving customer lifetime value. Monetizing business model transformation The obstacles and challenges associated with recurring subscription revenue processes are the result of organizations having pricing inflexibility and lacking the ability to scale, capture usage/consumption information or consolidate customer invoices properly. Challenge: A utilities provider required a process for creating ISU postings when the customer no longer had a service contract. This was required as ISU would only generate invoices when a service contract existed. With DXC’s help, implementing SAP Customer Experience Convergent Invoicing (CI) integrated to CRM & B for utilities resulted in consolidated invoices across environments — thereby readily providing invoices to customers without service contracts. Business Outcome • Out-of-the-box integration with ISU for converged revenue management • Automation of end-to-end processes lowered operating costs • Significantly reduced revenue leakage and provided more accurate revenue recognition. Challenge: A cargo shipping company wanted to move from a single-sided to multi-sided business model. By doing so, they were able to shift from fixed pricing to flexible pricing rates and from single communication channels to omni- channel customer engagement. Business Outcome • Deployed SAP S/4HANA BRIM, Convergent Mediation and Commerce Cloud for B2B • Increased revenue by providing right pricing and extending services offerings • Eliminated the potential revenue leakage • Increased customer experience by enabling omni-channel self service Return on investment—how do you measure value? Transforming to remain competitive Organizations that are focused on single customer transactions are losing the opportunities for repeat purchases and for generating predictable revenue streams. Organizations failing to transform in this direction is resulting in declining customer retention and reduced brand loyalty.

In the digital economy, consumers — Business to Business or Business to Consumer (B2B or B2C) — are driving how they engage, and companies are faced with finding new ways to provide a consistent customer experience regardless of device or channel. They must also capture customer engagement data and transform business models to find new sources of revenue growth. Updating monetization-related business processes can lead to reduced costs and the opportunity to increase revenue by reaching new markets. Moving away from the traditional process of selling products to selling subscription- and usage-based services provides companies with the agility to rapidly expand into new market segments and geographies. Update business processes Partner with the best: DXC offers a truly end-to-end service across the C/4HANA and S/4HANA portfolios.

Potential benefits and gains include cost reduction, increased revenue and the realization of new opportunities into extended market segements as well as geographic locations. DXC Technology clients have achieved measurable business benefits and return on investment through this offering. For example, a utility company required a process to create Industry Solution - Utilities (IS-U) postings for a customer without a service contract. SAP IS-U only permits invoices to be generated when an active service contract exists.

In this model, the merchants are put into a hierarchical structure. The entities that can be represented in the hierarchy structure are Acquirer, Merchants, Chains/Franchises, Payment Facilitators, Payment Aggregators, Value Added Resellers, and ISOs (Independent Sales Organizations). This slide shows five different scenarios / examples of representative business structures that can be represented in PowerCard. An Acquirer can organize its portfolio with multiple approaches, there is not a limitation on the setup of relationship scenarios. Scenario 1: An Acquirer with a direct relationship with merchants Scenario 2: An Acquirer with a Merchant Chain relationship (e.g. a large retailer with multiple locations like Tesco or Carrefour. Scenario 3: An Acquirer sponsoring processing for an ISO and VARs who sell payment processing services to merchants. Scenario 4: An Acquirer sponsoring processing for an ISO who sells to sub-ISO’s who in turn sell payment processing services to merchants. Scenario 5: An Acquirer sponsoring processing for an ISO who sells to merchants and a payment facilitator who sells processing services to small merchants. 6 Product Structure Event Driven Merchant Fees Merchant Contract Terms Fee Configuration Options Transactional Fees Event Driven Fees Set characteristics to define the product eligibility conditions Service Products are linked to transactions/batches Data attributes – card type, territoriality for card and/or merchant, transaction type, cardholder authentication, input mode, risk controls, pricing and billing fee attributes Multi-level portfolio hierarchy propagation of product characteristics Ability to customize product characteristics to market needs Data characteristics can be interrogated Tax Management – available at country, institution and acceptance point level Internal Events External Events Automatic (re-curing) Fees One time Fees Application of taxes Configurable base on transaction type, MCC, territoriality, currency Volume based / Tiered pricing Time-boxed Promotional Fees Blended Pricing Interchange+, Interchange++ Acceptance Products Flexible Configuration Selections from Catalog Acceptance Products Service or Event Products Equipment Services Define Points of Acceptance Specify Pricing Conditions Configure Settlement Options Controls for Contract Element(s) Activation  November 6, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential The DXC solution delivers a flexible solution for configuration of the fees typically associated with payment processing. Data characteristics are part of the configuration to define an acceptance product type around which a fee can be created. This enables Acquirers to customize their product and fee characteristics to meet market needs and to quickly adapt to changing market conditions to remain competitive. There are transactional fees and event driven fees (see slide of other characteristics). The fee toolset provides a path for Acquirers to offer and support effective and competitive contract terms for their merchant relationships. 7 Transaction Lifecycle Management Pre-Acquiring Data Capture Processing Acquiring Processes Scheme Interface  Format 1 … Format n Data Ingest & Controls Allocation Internal/External POS Interchange Decision Clearing Prep Posting Disputes and Chargeback Scheme Pre-Edit Scheme Outgoing Routing Scheme Incoming Product Structure Transaction Management and Interchange Interchange Qualification Jurisdiction Industry rules Term capability Transaction environment Entry mode Authentication method Transaction amount Authorization criteria Card type Interchange fees limits  Financial Transactions (& reversals) 1st, 2nd, 3rd presentments 1st and 2nd chargebacks Issuer’s fees Acquirer’s fees Administrative transactions Copy requests Answering copy requests Messages Authorization transactions Calls for authorization Notice and statements of authorization Cancellation of authorizations  Supported Transactions  November 6, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential The DXC solution supports the typical payment processing transaction types. The Transaction lifecycle illustrates the steps taken for handling of transactions. Pre-Acquiring: receipt of payment files from merchants and POS providers for processing. Data Capture Processing: initial ingest of transaction data into the system for editing and prep for subsequent processing steps. Acquiring Processing: Key processing step where transaction data is evaluated for interchange cost, data prep for clearing to scheme endpoint, posting into accumulators for eventual fee calculation and invoicing along with archiving the data to be used later for defending disputes/chargebacks. Scheme Interface: Final step for clearing outgoing transactions to the appropriate scheme where scheme pre-edit software (if available – e.g. VISA, MC) is executed. There is also an incoming component for data received from the card schemes (e.g. reconciliation data, rejected or returned items, fee collections, and chargeback data). Interchange qualification is a key ingredient to Acquiring as interchange is the largest expense for an Acquirer. The DXC toolset has an extensive ruleset that mimics scheme rules to evaluate transactions to get the best possible rate for an Acquirer when clearing a transaction. 8 Product Structure Settlement and Invoicing Invoicing Flexible Settlement Options Risk Mitigation Posting Mode Card Scheme Card Type Debit / Credit / Prepaid Transaction Type Transaction Category Configurable Frequency Portfolio Hierarchy Bank Account Currency Transaction Group (e.g. transaction, chargeback, fees, scheme fees) Detail (each item) Aggregated Payment Reserve Funds withheld until reserve threshold is met Released at Acquirer’s discretion / timeframe Payment Hold Funds held at Acquirer’s discretion Can be set at chain, sub-chain and merchant Settlement Criteria Settlement Rules Supported at desired hierarchy level: Terminal Outlet Merchant Chain Sub chain Controls Frequency Dynamic marketing inserts Multi-language support Raw statement file November 6, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential A key component of the competitive Acquirer processing landscape is to provide a solid set of settlement options for merchants. The DXC Acquirer toolset delivers on that with flexible settlement criteria where settlement to distinct bank accounts can occur based on Card Scheme, Card Type, Transaction Type, etc.) Additional settlement rules dictate which merchant data is selected for processing when a settlement run is executed. From a risk mitigation perspective, there are options for payment holds and a payment reserve amount where funds are held until a threshold amount is exceeded. From an invoice perspective, there is a lot of flexibility to configure for whom in the hierarchy relationship (as depicted on Slide 6), where the invoice information will be aggregated and produced. Invoice frequency can be daily, weekly or monthly. Raw statement files can be created and delivered to a clients preferred vendor for print and mail or electronic equivalent delivery. 9 Product Structure Integration Services Robust library of web services Services align with platform’s business functions Clients can directly consume services Re-usable, can be orchestrated to support new uses Onboarding, pricing, fee configuration, data inquiry Interface Files Onboarding API batch file Master Data extracts Payment Files Invoices / Statements for 3rd party print or hosting Extracts for client systems – e.g. Reconciliation, General Ledger Acquirer API Examples createMerchant addMerchantBankAccount addMerchantAddress updateMerchantAddress updateMerchantBankAccount addMerchantSite addMerchantOwner addMerchantActivitiy APIs  Data Files  Fraud Monitoring  Statements  Vendors  Card Schemes   November 6, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential In most card processing delivery models, there is a high degree of integration into a client’s environment. The typical interfaces include enterprise systems (e.g. General Ledger), merchant facing UI’s, invoices and bank payment data (e.g. ACH, BACS, SEPA). The DXC product set supports this key delivery component with robust APIs for onboarding and inquiry, and a solid ETL toolset for other interface needs.

In this model, the merchants are put into a hierarchical structure. The entities that can be represented in the hierarchy structure are Acquirer, Merchants, Chains/Franchises, Payment Facilitators, Payment Aggregators, Value Added Resellers, and ISOs (Independent Sales Organizations). This slide shows five different scenarios / examples of representative business structures that can be represented in PowerCard. An Acquirer can organize its portfolio with multiple approaches, there is not a limitation on the setup of relationship scenarios. Scenario 1: An Acquirer with a direct relationship with merchants Scenario 2: An Acquirer with a Merchant Chain relationship (e.g. a large retailer with multiple locations like Tesco or Carrefour. Scenario 3: An Acquirer sponsoring processing for an ISO and VARs who sell payment processing services to merchants. Scenario 4: An Acquirer sponsoring processing for an ISO who sells to sub-ISO’s who in turn sell payment processing services to merchants. Scenario 5: An Acquirer sponsoring processing for an ISO who sells to merchants and a payment facilitator who sells processing services to small merchants. 6 Product Structure Event Driven Merchant Fees Merchant Contract Terms Fee Configuration Options Transactional Fees Event Driven Fees Set characteristics to define the product eligibility conditions Service Products are linked to transactions/batches Data attributes – card type, territoriality for card and/or merchant, transaction type, cardholder authentication, input mode, risk controls, pricing and billing fee attributes Multi-level portfolio hierarchy propagation of product characteristics Ability to customize product characteristics to market needs Data characteristics can be interrogated Tax Management – available at country, institution and acceptance point level Internal Events External Events Automatic (re-curing) Fees One time Fees Application of taxes Configurable base on transaction type, MCC, territoriality, currency Volume based / Tiered pricing Time-boxed Promotional Fees Blended Pricing Interchange+, Interchange++ Acceptance Products Flexible Configuration Selections from Catalog Acceptance Products Service or Event Products Equipment Services Define Points of Acceptance Specify Pricing Conditions Configure Settlement Options Controls for Contract Element(s) Activation  November 6, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential The DXC solution delivers a flexible solution for configuration of the fees typically associated with payment processing. Data characteristics are part of the configuration to define an acceptance product type around which a fee can be created. This enables Acquirers to customize their product and fee characteristics to meet market needs and to quickly adapt to changing market conditions to remain competitive. There are transactional fees and event driven fees (see slide of other characteristics). The fee toolset provides a path for Acquirers to offer and support effective and competitive contract terms for their merchant relationships. 7 Transaction Lifecycle Management Pre-Acquiring Data Capture Processing Acquiring Processes Scheme Interface  Format 1 … Format n Data Ingest & Controls Allocation Internal/External POS Interchange Decision Clearing Prep Posting Disputes and Chargeback Scheme Pre-Edit Scheme Outgoing Routing Scheme Incoming Product Structure Transaction Management and Interchange Interchange Qualification Jurisdiction Industry rules Term capability Transaction environment Entry mode Authentication method Transaction amount Authorization criteria Card type Interchange fees limits  Financial Transactions (& reversals) 1st, 2nd, 3rd presentments 1st and 2nd chargebacks Issuer’s fees Acquirer’s fees Administrative transactions Copy requests Answering copy requests Messages Authorization transactions Calls for authorization Notice and statements of authorization Cancellation of authorizations  Supported Transactions  November 6, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential The DXC solution supports the typical payment processing transaction types. The Transaction lifecycle illustrates the steps taken for handling of transactions. Pre-Acquiring: receipt of payment files from merchants and POS providers for processing. Data Capture Processing: initial ingest of transaction data into the system for editing and prep for subsequent processing steps. Acquiring Processing: Key processing step where transaction data is evaluated for interchange cost, data prep for clearing to scheme endpoint, posting into accumulators for eventual fee calculation and invoicing along with archiving the data to be used later for defending disputes/chargebacks. Scheme Interface: Final step for clearing outgoing transactions to the appropriate scheme where scheme pre-edit software (if available – e.g. VISA, MC) is executed. There is also an incoming component for data received from the card schemes (e.g. reconciliation data, rejected or returned items, fee collections, and chargeback data). Interchange qualification is a key ingredient to Acquiring as interchange is the largest expense for an Acquirer. The DXC toolset has an extensive ruleset that mimics scheme rules to evaluate transactions to get the best possible rate for an Acquirer when clearing a transaction. 8 Product Structure Settlement and Invoicing Invoicing Flexible Settlement Options Risk Mitigation Posting Mode Card Scheme Card Type Debit / Credit / Prepaid Transaction Type Transaction Category Configurable Frequency Portfolio Hierarchy Bank Account Currency Transaction Group (e.g. transaction, chargeback, fees, scheme fees) Detail (each item) Aggregated Payment Reserve Funds withheld until reserve threshold is met Released at Acquirer’s discretion / timeframe Payment Hold Funds held at Acquirer’s discretion Can be set at chain, sub-chain and merchant Settlement Criteria Settlement Rules Supported at desired hierarchy level: Terminal Outlet Merchant Chain Sub chain Controls Frequency Dynamic marketing inserts Multi-language support Raw statement file November 6, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential A key component of the competitive Acquirer processing landscape is to provide a solid set of settlement options for merchants. The DXC Acquirer toolset delivers on that with flexible settlement criteria where settlement to distinct bank accounts can occur based on Card Scheme, Card Type, Transaction Type, etc.) Additional settlement rules dictate which merchant data is selected for processing when a settlement run is executed. From a risk mitigation perspective, there are options for payment holds and a payment reserve amount where funds are held until a threshold amount is exceeded. From an invoice perspective, there is a lot of flexibility to configure for whom in the hierarchy relationship (as depicted on Slide 6), where the invoice information will be aggregated and produced. Invoice frequency can be daily, weekly or monthly. Raw statement files can be created and delivered to a clients preferred vendor for print and mail or electronic equivalent delivery. 9 Product Structure Integration Services Robust library of web services Services align with platform’s business functions Clients can directly consume services Re-usable, can be orchestrated to support new uses Onboarding, pricing, fee configuration, data inquiry Interface Files Onboarding API batch file Master Data extracts Payment Files Invoices / Statements for 3rd party print or hosting Extracts for client systems – e.g. Reconciliation, General Ledger Acquirer API Examples createMerchant addMerchantBankAccount addMerchantAddress updateMerchantAddress updateMerchantBankAccount addMerchantSite addMerchantOwner addMerchantActivitiy APIs  Data Files  Fraud Monitoring  Statements  Vendors  Card Schemes   November 6, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential In most card processing delivery models, there is a high degree of integration into a client’s environment. The typical interfaces include enterprise systems (e.g. General Ledger), merchant facing UI’s, invoices and bank payment data (e.g. ACH, BACS, SEPA). The DXC product set supports this key delivery component with robust APIs for onboarding and inquiry, and a solid ETL toolset for other interface needs.

For Delivery Center, Cloud, and/or Central IT Reports, the report is costed per Delivery Center, Cloud or Central IT environment. For Delivery Center, Cloud, and/or Central IT Report(s) + Logical Access, the report is costed Delivery Center, Cloud, and/or Central IT plus cost applied per Operating System. If the customer has administrative access to the OS, the Service Provider (DXC) cannot be responsible for the audit on those servers and thus cannot provide the SOC 1 Report. Unless another report is explicitly requested by the customer, the leveraged SOC 1 Type II is what is typically provided to the customer interested in Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) financial controls reporting. SOC 2 A SOC 2 cannot be used to replace a SOC 1 based on AICPA guidelines. A SOC 2 should not be used for financial reporting such as SOX. SOC 2 is used by customers to ensure security practices are followed based on the contract. SOC 2 reports are typically more time consuming and costly to produce. Obtaining a quote for creation of a SOC 2 report will require that you solicit support from the TPA SOC Reporting Team.

November 5, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Logical Access: Inventory Guidelines There is a higher risk of deviations/Qualifications if the below guidelines are not followed. Servers to Include Servers to Exclude SOX servers only that are used for the customer’s financial reporting Production servers only Servers with customer administrative rights or elevated privileges Servers that do not have customer data Servers NOT managed by DXC or are managed by the customer or a third party or using customer dedicated tools. Servers that are decommissioned at any time during the review period (retain change tickets) Test, model office, development, transitioning, file, tools management, print and mail servers  Servers that have been verified for compliance Other items to consider: If servers are not managed to DXC standards, we must obtain physical documentation of the customer’s policies/standards If DXC is contractually required to follow customer standards and the standards are not available, then it may be necessary to modify the controls/testing included in scope or we may not have sufficient controls to warrant including in a SOC 1 audit report Applications are considered customer specific and requires a customer specific quote Servers reporting in a compliance management tool such as Symantec CCS or PCM November 5, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 33 Logical Access Verifying Compliance on Server Population  The checklists contain all items that will be audited for logical access. Mainframe compliance is already confirmed for systems included in QEX or SOC Proactive Campaign Assessments. If a Mainframe system is not part of QEX, it will be the account’s responsibility to verify compliance. It’s imperative that all servers in the population are verified for compliance for each of those items prior to March 1st Compliance Checklist User Access Testing 5 to 25 users are sampled on each sampled server. Therefore, it’s critical that a User Access Review is conducted before servers are placed in scope of the audit. If terminated users still have access to the servers, then there will more than likely be deviations in the audit report. Deadline Compliance should be verified on all servers/databases in the population by March 1, 2019.   Note: A “DXC Universal Script Evidence Location(s)” has been added to the checklist for reference for Windows and UNIX systems only. If a universal script is not available, accounts will need to run an account custom script or use a 3rd party tool to verify compliance. 2019 Compliance Checklist November 5, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Additional Notes The auditor Excel form ‘Data’ tab and the server scans using the Universal Script hold the same information. The auditor typically imports it for easy reference. 34 Data Centers - 2019 Facility Type ES CSC Region Country Site Name SOC Site Code Site Address DC CSC ANZ Australia Pyrmont, Sydney PY1 13a Union Street, Pyrmont (Sydney) DC ES ANZ Australia East Burwood EBU 1 4 Wesley Court, Tally Ho Business Park, Burwood East, Victoria, 3151, Australia COL ES ANZ Australia Sydney Australia ULT1 ULTIMO - 400 Harris Street - New South Wales 2007, Australia, Also knowN as GSU (Global Switch) COL ES ANZ Australia Eastern Creek, Australia AUR1 Aurora Lot 2, DP 1159804 Corner Capicure Drv and Roberts Road; Eastern Creek, NSW, 2766 COL ES SE Belgium Muizen, Belgium (Syntigo) N/A Hewlett Packard Company - c/o Syntigo sa/nv , Smisstraat 48 , 2812 Muizen BELGIUM DC ES Americas Brazil Alphaville, Brazil ALP1 Alameda Rio Negro, 530 - Alphaville, Barueri, São Paulo CEP 06454-000 DC ES Americas Brazil Alphaville, Brazil ALP2 Alameda Rio Negro, 530 - Alphaville, Barueri, São Paulo CEP 06454-000 (same building/2 sites) DC ES Americas Brazil Anchieta, Brazil ANC1 Marginal Direita Via Anchieta KM 17,5 - Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo CEP 09893-000 DC ES Americas Canada Toronto, Ontario TOR1 Markham Computing Center (MCC) - 1320 Denison Street, Markham, Ontario L3R 4K6 Canada DC ES Americas Canada Toronto, Ontario TOR2 Streetsville Computing Centre (SCC) - 1855 Minnesota Court, Mississauga, Ontario L5N 1K7 Canada GOC ES AMEA China Dalian, China ABS India N/A Shanghai HP - Building 12, No 21 East Road GOC ES AMEA China Dalian, China ABS India N/A Dalian Software Park, Dalian, 116023, China GOC ES Americas Costa Rica Costa Rica ABS India N/A Costa Rica Ultra Park 2:Heredia Lagunilla.

If and when Client XXX is off-boarding from DXC and still has open findings, Service Provider will: · 1 Findings related to a Client that is no longer a DXC customer (one that has exited) are deemed no longer relevant; they are only relevant during the time the client is in the DXC environment; · Updates on prior report findings will be provided in client letters or subsequent reports if prior to a client exit, and; · Non-qualifying findings that are still open are not required to be remediated prior to client exit; · Provide regulators/Third Party Auditors with a letter with information including control changes, resolutions of significant issues, etc. going through the date of Client exit. Audit Follow-Up: Add language below: · Audit Follow-Up. Service Provider and Client XXX shall meet to review each audit report promptly and to mutually agree upon an appropriate and effective manner in which to respond to the deficiencies identified and changes suggested by the audit report. NOTES: Additional guidance from Legal AUDIT Contracting Rules: If customer has Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)/financial controls audit requirements: · DXC’s preference is to provide customer an ISAE 3402/SSAE 18 System and Service Organization Control 1 (SOC 1), Type 2, report, released annually, that includes DXC’s financially relevant standard IT processes and DXC-defined controls that align to the AICPA’s SOC 1 audit guidance. · Customer can be included within scope once their processes have been fully transitioned and managed by DXC for a minimum of 6 months. The cost of the required standard SOC 1 report(s) should be added to the cost model and charges. · If customer is not using DXC standard practices, requires a customer specific SOC 1 report, or has specific SOX 404 and/or security requirements, the requirements need to be assessed during the bid process and tailored accordingly. The costs (both internal and external) of any customer-specific reports should be passed through to customer, or added to the cost model and charges. Note: Costs can be substantial, and pricing needs to be obtained from the Third Party Assurance Program (isae3402@dxc.com). There is no “standard” pricing – all reports are priced according to scope, services, environment size, etc. TPA SOC Reporting ServicesDelivery Center, Cloud, Central ITDelivery Center, Cloud, Central IT(Leveraged Environments)Customer SpecificDelivery Center (DC)DC SOC 2 Type II Cloud InfraDC SOC 1 Type II VPC SOC 2 Type II VPC SOC 1 Type II CBU SOC 1 Type II Central IT SOC 1 Type II Base minus Physical SecurityCustomer Leveraged Add Logical Access for specified DXC compliance checks to any Base SOC 1 and/or SOC 2 ReportCustomer Specific ReportsOtherSOC 1 Type II DXC PoliciesSOC 1 Type II DXC Policies DC Base + Customer Specific Logical Access + Other Customer Specified Controls based on DXC compliance checks DC non-base site(s)SOC 1 Type II Client Policies  Base + Logical Access + Other for specified Client compliance checksSOC 2 Type IIDXC Policies DC non-base site(s) + one or more TSPsVPC InfraSOC 1 Type II DXC Policies Base + Logical Access for specified DXC compliance checks and/or other controlsSOC 2 Type II DXC PoliciesCBU InfraSOC 1 Type II DXC Policies Base + Logical Access and/or other controlsSOC 1 Type II DXC Policies AWS & Azure client zones only (future) Covers TSPs + Logical Access based on DXC compliance and/or other controlsCustomer Leveraged Reports Microsoft Excel Worksheet Unix-Linux-Other Priority Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: This is an auditor assigned priority or 'weight'. It is not necessarily the same as the DXC ESIS risk level. It is determined by the auditors. Platform Qualification (fail) Risk Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: These risk comments are based on audit experience only and are not vetted by the auditors DXC ESIS Assessment Procedure(s) DXC Owner Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: The owner is generally which capability maintains compliance when there is separation of duties. Matrix Item # Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: This is an EY Matrix Item number that relates to the same item in the EY forms used during the audit. PLATFORM=Unix-Linux-VMWare-Other (HP-UX example) DXC Checklist Item Description Is compliance verified (Yes/No)? DXC Universal Script Evidence Location(s) Medium One shared account deviation on one server can fail the platform. One or more cases where we cannot provide last login evidence of an inappropriate user can fail the platform. SAP0582 SAP0592 SAP0595 SAP0583 Security 00 User Access and Shared Account Testing - These Assessment Procedures are related to User Testing. The evidence is found in the compliance scan outfiles. Compliance includes a manual review of accounts for appropriateness. A current Manager/Leader email approval is needed for evidence during the audit. User attestation evidence and user request tickets are not acceptable evidence. Currently, all accounts are in scope with the same weight, whether privileged or not. We are targeting 2019 to prepare for an audit of only privileged accounts. - Privileged full root access via sudo rules (or other 3rd party tool) must also be reviewed for appropriateness. System Administrators should be the only group with full root access. - When the password is shared without accountability for who is using it, a Risk Acceptance Letter (RAL) is required if interactive login is not prevented. An exception to this is for those applications that store a password to function properly. Exception - An account can request client specific testing that includes auditing user attestation evidence done on a regular basis. This can take the place of a current manager approval. This is not common. IMPORTANT NOTE - If an account is removed, we must have a screen print of the hostname, date/time and last login at the time of removal. Without it, this lack of evidence showing whether one account logged in during the audit period, could qualify (fail) the whole platform. Always save this last login information when removing any account. It can help lower the weight of a deviation. Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: Additional Shared ID Questions: 1. Does the client have full control of this ID? IF yes, explain this in the response, no further evidence needed. 2. Verify the number of people who know the password. 3. Verify the ID can be used at a login prompt (= interactive login). Is it used to login interactively? 4. For interactive logins, can more than one person login to the ID at the same time? 5. Are SSH keys used to support access for this ID versus a login prompt? 6. Provide a screen print of the last login date being sure the server name is showing (For Unix/Linux, the finger cmd). 7. Is there some way of tracking accountability of the use of the ID? i.e. how to know which person physically logged in to the ID; is there a password checkout/then change process?; is there a log of each use? etc. 8. Is the ID used for emergency situations only? Is there documentation on a process to checkout the ID for use? 9. Is there vendor documentation saying the ID must have a password and interactive login? We would need the vendor doc and page number(s). 0|2|Accounts-Activity Dates Code|UID|Username|LastUpdate|LastLogin|PwdChanged|LastLog|SuLog|SudoLog|TelnetLog|FtpLog|AcctExp|LDAPuser 0|5|Accounts-General Settings Code|Username|UID|Status|Gecos|HomeDir|HomeOwner|HomeGroupOwner|HomePermissions|HomeExists|Shell|CronExists|CreateDate|cmNumber|LDAPuser 0|20|File Contents| 20|SUDOERS|/etc/sudoers|...

Typically this is with root authority, for example, changing your password. If these parameters are on unexpected executable files, it could potentially compromise the server. These files are explained or remediated versus justified. A server-wide find command for setuid/setgid, root owned, world write is used to check for compliance, there should be none with this combination. Deviations have been experienced when old software applications are left idle with setuid/setgid flags on executables. - If for some reason the scan for setuid/setgid files needs to be run manually (vs part of the standalone scripts), the auditors have provided the following Linux flavor of the command that should be piped to a text file.

One case where we cannot provide compensating controls for an inappropriate Administrator, i.e. missing last login evidence of an inappropriate user can fail the platform. SAP0568 SAP0582 SAP0583 SAP0595 Security 02 Administrator Tracking and Shared Account Testing - Be aware these Assessment Procedures are related to Admin testing. The local Administrator accounts are found by server scans and expanding groups including domain groups. This audit includes a review of accounts where the password is shared and requires justification if not locked for login. Administrator access given by a 3rd party tool should also be reviewed for appropriateness. The audit will pick a sampling of Administrators and current manager/leader evidence of appropriate access is required. A current Manager/Leader email approval is needed for evidence during the audit. User attestation evidence and user request tickets are not acceptable evidence. - When the password is shared without accountability for who is using it, a Risk Acceptance Letter (RAL) is required if interactive login is not prevented. An exception to this is for those applications that store a password to function properly. Exception - An account can request client specific testing that includes auditing user attestation evidence done on a regular basis. This can take the place of a current manager approval. This is not common. IMPORTANT NOTE - If an account is removed, we must have a screen print of the hostname, date/time and last login at the time of removal. Without it, this lack of evidence showing whether one account logged in during the audit period, could qualify (fail) the whole platform. Always save this last login information when removing any account. It can help lower the weight of a deviation. Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: Additional Shared ID Questions: 1. Does the client have full control of this ID? IF yes, explain this in the response, no further evidence needed. 2. Verify the number of people who know the password. 3. Verify the ID can be used at a login prompt (= interactive login). Is it used to login interactively? 4. For interactive logins, can more than one person login to the ID at the same time? 5. Are SSH keys used to support access for this ID versus a login prompt? 6. Provide a screen print of the last login date being sure the server name is showing (For Unix/Linux, the finger cmd). 7. Is there some way of tracking accountability of the use of the ID? i.e. how to know which person physically logged in to the ID; is there a password checkout/then change process?; is there a log of each use? etc. 8. Is the ID used for emergency situations only? Is there documentation on a process to checkout the ID for use? 9. Is there vendor documentation saying the ID must have a password and interactive login? We would need the vendor doc and page number(s). This 'Administrator' population is provided to the auditors starting with the list created by the DXC WINDOWS-AD-Gather_Local_Users.vbs script. Then the local and domain groups need to be expanded to complete the population. The results are inserted as attachments into the auditor Windows Admin Tracker form (MRLA201) In addition, the Win_List_Rights.ps1 script is run to provide evidence of deny login parameters. This script requires PowerShell and so is optional if it is not available on the server. It displays Deny logon locally, Deny logon via RDP, Allow logon as a Service.

PLATFORM= NonStop Checklist Item Description Is compliance verified (Yes/No)? DXC Universal Script Evidence Location(s) Medium One shared account deviation on one server can fail the platform. One or more cases where we cannot provide last login evidence of an inappropriate user can fail the platform. SAP0582 SAP0592 SAP0595 SAP0583 Security 00 User Access and Shared Account Testing - These Assessment Procedures are related to User Testing. The evidence is found in the Request List outfiles. Compliance includes a manual review of accounts for appropriateness. A current Manager/Leader email approval is needed for evidence during the audit. User attestation evidence and user request tickets are not acceptable evidence. Currently, all accounts are in scope with the same weight, whether privileged or not. We are targeting 2019 to prepare for an audit of only privileged accounts. - Privileged access must also be reviewed for appropriateness. System Administrators should be the only group with full privileged or super access. - When the password is shared without accountability for who is using it, a Risk Acceptance Letter (RAL) is required if interactive login is not prevented. An exception to this is for those applications that store a password to function properly. Exception - An account can request client specific testing that includes auditing user attestation evidence done on a regular basis. This can take the place of a current manager approval. This is not common. IMPORTANT NOTE - If an account is removed, we must have a screen print of the hostname, date/time and last login at the time of removal. Without it, this lack of evidence showing whether one account logged in during the audit period, could fail the whole platform. Always save this last login information when removing any account. It can help lower the weight of a deviation. Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: Additional Shared ID Questions: 1. Does the client have full control of this ID? IF yes, explain this in the response, no further evidence needed. 2. Verify the number of people who know the password. 3. Verify the ID can be used at a login prompt (= interactive login). Is it used to login interactively? 4. For interactive logins, can more than one person login to the ID at the same time? 5. Are SSH keys used to support access for this ID versus a login prompt? 6. Provide a screen print of the last login date being sure the server name is showing (For Unix/Linux, the finger cmd). 7. Is there some way of tracking accountability of the use of the ID? i.e. how to know which person physically logged in to the ID; is there a password checkout/then change process?; is there a log of each use? etc. 8.

Matrix Item # Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: This is an EY Matrix Item number that relates to the same item in the EY forms used during the audit. PLATFORM=DB2 DXC Checklist Item Description Is compliance verified (Yes/No)? DXC Universal Script Evidence Location(s) Medium One inappropriate user or one shared account deviation on one server can fail the platform. One case where we cannot provide compensating controls for an inappropriate user, i.e. missing last login evidence of an inappropriate user can fail the platform. SAP0582 SAP0592 SAP0595 SAP0584 Security 00 User Access and Shared Account Testing - Be aware these Assessment Procedures are related to User Testing. The evidence is found in script outfiles or command request lists. This includes a review of accounts where the password is shared and requires justification if not locked for login. Privileged access via a 3rd party tool should also be reviewed for appropriateness. The auditor will select accounts to review for appropriateness, i.e. is the ID appropriate to have access to the DB. Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: Additional Shared ID Questions: 1. Does the client have full control of this ID? IF yes, explain this in the response, no further evidence needed. 2. Verify the number of people who know the password. 3. Verify the ID can be used at a login prompt (= interactive login). Is it used to login interactively? 4. For interactive logins, can more than one person login to the ID at the same time? 5. Are SSH keys used to support access for this ID versus a login prompt? 6. Provide a screen print of the last login date being sure the server name is showing (For Unix/Linux, the finger cmd). 7. Is there some way of tracking accountability of the use of the ID? i.e. how to know which person physically logged in to the ID; is there a password checkout/then change process?; is there a log of each use? etc. 8. Is the ID used for emergency situations only? Is there documentation on a process to checkout the ID for use? 9. Is there vendor documentation saying the ID must have a password and interactive login? We would need the vendor doc and page number(s).

Confirm the following: The type of regulatory audit report needed (i.e., SOC 1, SOC 2, etc.) The controls required to be in scope of the audit. Controls should be limited to only those areas serviced/managed by DXC that impacts the client’s financial reporting. The required audit period (The standard audit period is Oct 1 thru Sept 30 annually so please make every attempt to accommodate this standard period.) The final report issue date (If contractual, please ensure that the TPA team is aware of the contractual date.) Once all of the above is confirmed, it’s time to reach out to the Third Party Assurance team for guidance to confirm the best report that will suffice to meet the customer’s requirements or if a client specific quote is needed.

On or about November 15, 2019 and annually thereafter, Supplier shall provide a copy of its SOC 2 Reports to Customer XXX and its Auditors. Each SOC 2 Report must cover a testing period of at least 9 months The SOC 2 Report will cover the Security Principle and the common controls criteria created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Legal Audit Contracting Guidance: If customer is: not using DXC standard practices, requires a Customer Specific SOC 1 report, or has specific SOX 404 and/or security requirements, the requirements need to be assessed during the bid process and tailored accordingly The costs (both internal and external) of any Customer Specific reports should be: passed through to customer, or added to the cost model and charges November 5, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential General Solution Design Guidelines SOC 1 Verify with the customer if they want a copy of the SOC 1 Delivery Center Report because there are charges associated with it. For Delivery Center, Cloud, and/or Central IT Reports, the report is costed per Delivery Center, Cloud or Central IT environment. For Delivery Center, Cloud, and/or Central IT Report(s) + Logical Access, the report is costed Delivery Center, Cloud, and/or Central IT plus cost applied per Operating System. If the customer has administrative access to the OS, the Service Provider (DXC) cannot be responsible for the audit on those servers and thus cannot provide the SOC 1 Report. Unless another report is explicitly requested by the customer, the leveraged SOC 1 Type II is what is typically provided to the customer interested in Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) financial controls reporting. SOC 2 A SOC 2 cannot be used to replace a SOC 1 based on AICPA guidelines. A SOC 2 should not be used for financial reporting such as SOX. SOC 2 is used by customers to ensure security practices are followed based on the contract. SOC 2 reports are typically more time consuming and costly to produce. Obtaining a quote for creation of a SOC 2 report will require that you solicit support from the TPA SOC Reporting Team. November 5, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential General Solution Design Guidelines Customer Specific Reports vary widely based the control objectives the customer wants in scope.

Servers that are decommissioned at any time during the review period (retain change tickets) Test, model office, development, transitioning, file, tools management, print and mail servers  Servers that have been verified for compliance Other items to consider: If servers are not managed to DXC standards, we must obtain physical documentation of the customer’s policies/standards If DXC is contractually required to follow customer standards and the standards are not available, then it may be necessary to modify the controls/testing included in scope or we may not have sufficient controls to warrant including in a SOC 1 audit report Applications are considered customer specific and requires a customer specific quote Servers reporting in a compliance management tool such as Symantec CCS or PCM November 5, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 33 Logical Access Verifying Compliance on Server Population  The checklists contain all items that will be audited for logical access. Mainframe compliance is already confirmed for systems included in QEX or SOC Proactive Campaign Assessments. If a Mainframe system is not part of QEX, it will be the account’s responsibility to verify compliance. It’s imperative that all servers in the population are verified for compliance for each of those items prior to March 1st Compliance Checklist User Access Testing 5 to 25 users are sampled on each sampled server. Therefore, it’s critical that a User Access Review is conducted before servers are placed in scope of the audit. If terminated users still have access to the servers, then there will more than likely be deviations in the audit report. Deadline Compliance should be verified on all servers/databases in the population by March 1, 2019.   Note: A “DXC Universal Script Evidence Location(s)” has been added to the checklist for reference for Windows and UNIX systems only. If a universal script is not available, accounts will need to run an account custom script or use a 3rd party tool to verify compliance. 2019 Compliance Checklist November 5, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Additional Notes The auditor Excel form ‘Data’ tab and the server scans using the Universal Script hold the same information.

NOTES: Additional guidance from Legal AUDIT Contracting Rules: If customer has Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)/financial controls audit requirements: · DXC’s preference is to provide customer an ISAE 3402/SSAE 18 System and Service Organization Control 1 (SOC 1), Type 2, report, released annually, that includes DXC’s financially relevant standard IT processes and DXC-defined controls that align to the AICPA’s SOC 1 audit guidance. · Customer can be included within scope once their processes have been fully transitioned and managed by DXC for a minimum of 6 months. The cost of the required standard SOC 1 report(s) should be added to the cost model and charges. · If customer is not using DXC standard practices, requires a customer specific SOC 1 report, or has specific SOX 404 and/or security requirements, the requirements need to be assessed during the bid process and tailored accordingly. The costs (both internal and external) of any customer-specific reports should be passed through to customer, or added to the cost model and charges. Note: Costs can be substantial, and pricing needs to be obtained from the Third Party Assurance Program (isae3402@dxc.com).

It is not necessarily the same as the DXC ESIS risk level. It is determined by the auditors. Platform Qualification (fail) Risk Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: These risk comments are based on audit experience only and are not vetted by the auditors DXC ESIS Assessment Procedure(s) DXC Owner Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: The owner is generally which capability maintains compliance when there is separation of duties. Matrix Item # Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: This is an EY Matrix Item number that relates to the same item in the EY forms used during the audit. PLATFORM=Unix-Linux-VMWare-Other (HP-UX example) DXC Checklist Item Description Is compliance verified (Yes/No)? DXC Universal Script Evidence Location(s) Medium One shared account deviation on one server can fail the platform. One or more cases where we cannot provide last login evidence of an inappropriate user can fail the platform. SAP0582 SAP0592 SAP0595 SAP0583 Security 00 User Access and Shared Account Testing - These Assessment Procedures are related to User Testing. The evidence is found in the compliance scan outfiles. Compliance includes a manual review of accounts for appropriateness. A current Manager/Leader email approval is needed for evidence during the audit. User attestation evidence and user request tickets are not acceptable evidence. Currently, all accounts are in scope with the same weight, whether privileged or not. We are targeting 2019 to prepare for an audit of only privileged accounts. - Privileged full root access via sudo rules (or other 3rd party tool) must also be reviewed for appropriateness. System Administrators should be the only group with full root access. - When the password is shared without accountability for who is using it, a Risk Acceptance Letter (RAL) is required if interactive login is not prevented. An exception to this is for those applications that store a password to function properly. Exception - An account can request client specific testing that includes auditing user attestation evidence done on a regular basis. This can take the place of a current manager approval. This is not common. IMPORTANT NOTE - If an account is removed, we must have a screen print of the hostname, date/time and last login at the time of removal. Without it, this lack of evidence showing whether one account logged in during the audit period, could qualify (fail) the whole platform. Always save this last login information when removing any account. It can help lower the weight of a deviation. Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: Additional Shared ID Questions: 1. Does the client have full control of this ID? IF yes, explain this in the response, no further evidence needed. 2. Verify the number of people who know the password. 3. Verify the ID can be used at a login prompt (= interactive login). Is it used to login interactively? 4. For interactive logins, can more than one person login to the ID at the same time? 5. Are SSH keys used to support access for this ID versus a login prompt? 6. Provide a screen print of the last login date being sure the server name is showing (For Unix/Linux, the finger cmd). 7. Is there some way of tracking accountability of the use of the ID? i.e. how to know which person physically logged in to the ID; is there a password checkout/then change process?; is there a log of each use? etc. 8. Is the ID used for emergency situations only? Is there documentation on a process to checkout the ID for use? 9. Is there vendor documentation saying the ID must have a password and interactive login? We would need the vendor doc and page number(s). 0|2|Accounts-Activity Dates Code|UID|Username|LastUpdate|LastLogin|PwdChanged|LastLog|SuLog|SudoLog|TelnetLog|FtpLog|AcctExp|LDAPuser 0|5|Accounts-General Settings Code|Username|UID|Status|Gecos|HomeDir|HomeOwner|HomeGroupOwner|HomePermissions|HomeExists|Shell|CronExists|CreateDate|cmNumber|LDAPuser 0|20|File Contents| 20|SUDOERS|/etc/sudoers|...

One case where we cannot provide compensating controls for an inappropriate Administrator, i.e. missing last login evidence of an inappropriate user can fail the platform. SAP0568 SAP0582 SAP0583 SAP0595 Security 02 Administrator Tracking and Shared Account Testing - Be aware these Assessment Procedures are related to Admin testing. The local Administrator accounts are found by server scans and expanding groups including domain groups. This audit includes a review of accounts where the password is shared and requires justification if not locked for login. Administrator access given by a 3rd party tool should also be reviewed for appropriateness. The audit will pick a sampling of Administrators and current manager/leader evidence of appropriate access is required. A current Manager/Leader email approval is needed for evidence during the audit. User attestation evidence and user request tickets are not acceptable evidence. - When the password is shared without accountability for who is using it, a Risk Acceptance Letter (RAL) is required if interactive login is not prevented. An exception to this is for those applications that store a password to function properly. Exception - An account can request client specific testing that includes auditing user attestation evidence done on a regular basis. This can take the place of a current manager approval. This is not common. IMPORTANT NOTE - If an account is removed, we must have a screen print of the hostname, date/time and last login at the time of removal. Without it, this lack of evidence showing whether one account logged in during the audit period, could qualify (fail) the whole platform. Always save this last login information when removing any account. It can help lower the weight of a deviation. Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: Additional Shared ID Questions: 1. Does the client have full control of this ID? IF yes, explain this in the response, no further evidence needed. 2. Verify the number of people who know the password. 3. Verify the ID can be used at a login prompt (= interactive login). Is it used to login interactively? 4. For interactive logins, can more than one person login to the ID at the same time? 5. Are SSH keys used to support access for this ID versus a login prompt? 6. Provide a screen print of the last login date being sure the server name is showing (For Unix/Linux, the finger cmd). 7. Is there some way of tracking accountability of the use of the ID? i.e. how to know which person physically logged in to the ID; is there a password checkout/then change process?; is there a log of each use? etc. 8. Is the ID used for emergency situations only? Is there documentation on a process to checkout the ID for use? 9. Is there vendor documentation saying the ID must have a password and interactive login? We would need the vendor doc and page number(s). This 'Administrator' population is provided to the auditors starting with the list created by the DXC WINDOWS-AD-Gather_Local_Users.vbs script. Then the local and domain groups need to be expanded to complete the population. The results are inserted as attachments into the auditor Windows Admin Tracker form (MRLA201) In addition, the Win_List_Rights.ps1 script is run to provide evidence of deny login parameters. This script requires PowerShell and so is optional if it is not available on the server. It displays Deny logon locally, Deny logon via RDP, Allow logon as a Service.

Matrix Item # Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: This is an EY Matrix Item number that relates to the same item in the EY forms used during the audit. PLATFORM=ESXi-VMWare DXC Checklist Item Description Is compliance verified (Yes/No)? DXC Universal Script Evidence Location(s) Medium One shared account deviation on one server can fail the platform. One or more cases where we cannot provide compensating controls, i.e. missing last login evidence of an inappropriate user can fail the platform. SAP0582 SAP0583 SAP0592 SAP0595 00 User Access and Shared Account Testing - These Assessment Procedures are related to User Testing. The evidence is found in the Request List outfiles. Compliance includes a manual review of accounts for appropriateness. A current Manager/Leader email approval is needed for evidence during the audit. User attestation evidence and user request tickets are not acceptable evidence. Currently, all accounts are in scope with the same weight, whether privileged or not. We are targeting 2019 to prepare for an audit of only privileged accounts. - Privileged full root access via sudo rules (or other 3rd party tool) must also be reviewed for appropriateness. System Administrators should be the only group with full root access. - When the password is shared without accountability for who is using it, a Risk Acceptance Letter (RAL) is required if interactive login is not prevented. An exception to this is for those applications that store a password to function properly. Exception - An account can request client specific testing that includes auditing user attestation evidence done on a regular basis. This can take the place of a current manager approval. This is not common. IMPORTANT NOTE - If an account is removed, we must have a screen print of the hostname, date/time and last login at the time of removal. Without it, this lack of evidence showing whether one account logged in during the audit period, could fail the whole platform. Always save this last login information when removing any account. It can help lower the weight of a deviation. Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: Additional Shared ID Questions: 1. Does the client have full control of this ID? IF yes, explain this in the response, no further evidence needed. 2. Verify the number of people who know the password. 3. Verify the ID can be used at a login prompt (= interactive login). Is it used to login interactively? 4. For interactive logins, can more than one person login to the ID at the same time? 5. Are SSH keys used to support access for this ID versus a login prompt? 6. Provide a screen print of the last login date being sure the server name is showing (For Unix/Linux, the finger cmd). 7. Is there some way of tracking accountability of the use of the ID? i.e. how to know which person physically logged in to the ID; is there a password checkout/then change process?; is there a log of each use? etc. 8. Is the ID used for emergency situations only? Is there documentation on a process to checkout the ID for use? 9. Is there vendor documentation saying the ID must have a password and interactive login? We would need the vendor doc and page number(s).

Check for UID=0 (#) 2. the SU command was logged. - Only root should have UID = 0 - SU log must be allocated and not world writable - Deviations due to the client require client approval (an Exception-to-Process (EtP) or ESIS RAL). High Having one PermitRootLogin yes on one server can fail a platform. SAP1178 Software 05c Verify ROOT Login Limited to Console - Check that root can login directly only through the console. - root access should only be via console. Console access is typically implemented by some sort of appliance device. For day to day activities, root type access should be by the use of sudo commands or switch user (su to root). These methods log authentication and provide some level of accountability, especially if real time central logging is implemented. - Server system mainteance, for example, may require remote root console access and is typically accompanied by a change ticket. This access must be turned off after system maintenance. remote root SSH via authorized keys is also considered non-compliant. - Typically there is no risk acceptance for this item. It should be compliant at all times. - NOTE- only one server non-compliant will fail an audit report. SSH PermitRootlogin should also be set to no and should not default. Medium Having an inappropriate user associated with the OS root account can make this one a 'High' and can fail a platform.

DCUI specifies which users can log into a host that is lockdown mode. The DCUI can be disabled to prevent any local administration from the Host. Once the DCUI is disabled any administration of the ESXi host will be done through vCenter which is also audited. Actions performed from the DCUI are not tracked by vCenter Server. - Deviations due to the client require client approval (an Exception-to-Process (EtP) or ESIS RAL).

SAP0369 Security 09a /etc/passwd and /etc/security/opasswd, /etc/shadow files access are properly restricted. - Critical system files should not be world writable. - Verify world writeable critical Operating System files owned by root are appropriate. Typically this is a review for appropriateness. The list of selected files for this item varies. Review the following critical directories for root owned critical system files that should not be world write: /, /sbin, /usr/sbin, /bin, /usr/bin, /etc. Also, system log files should not be world writeable. - If for some reason, inappropriate world writes cannot be remediated, deviations due to the client require client approval (an Exception-to-Process (EtP) or ESIS RAL).

DXC Universal Script Evidence Location(s) Medium One inappropriate user or one shared account deviation on one server can fail the platform. One case where we cannot provide compensating controls for an inappropriate user, i.e. missing last login evidence of an inappropriate user can fail the platform. SAP0582 SAP0592 SAP0595 SAP0584 Security 00 User Access and Shared Account Testing - Be aware these Assessment Procedures are related to User Testing. The evidence is found in script outfiles or command request lists. This includes a review of accounts where the password is shared and requires justification if not locked for login. Privileged access via a 3rd party tool should also be reviewed for appropriateness. The auditor will select accounts to review for appropriateness, i.e. is the ID appropriate to have access to the DB. Terri Zimmerman: Terri Zimmerman: Additional Shared ID Questions: 1. Does the client have full control of this ID? IF yes, explain this in the response, no further evidence needed. 2. Verify the number of people who know the password. 3. Verify the ID can be used at a login prompt (= interactive login). Is it used to login interactively? 4. For interactive logins, can more than one person login to the ID at the same time? 5. Are SSH keys used to support access for this ID versus a login prompt? 6. Provide a screen print of the last login date being sure the server name is showing (For Unix/Linux, the finger cmd). 7. Is there some way of tracking accountability of the use of the ID? i.e. how to know which person physically logged in to the ID; is there a password checkout/then change process?; is there a log of each use? etc. 8. Is the ID used for emergency situations only? Is there documentation on a process to checkout the ID for use? 9. Is there vendor documentation saying the ID must have a password and interactive login? We would need the vendor doc and page number(s). (n/a for this platform - no script available - see Request List manual evidence) 01 This Item Intentionally Blank High SAP0591 Security 02 Account Logon Retries (ESIS=6) (#) - The Sybase maximum failed login attempts setting can be set at the global level and by user and by role. The user level setting overrides the global setting. The default is unlimited. Set the limit to 6 attempts. To configure maximum failed login attempts: exec sp_configure 'maximum failed logins', 6 To verify: exec sp_configure 'maximum failed logins' - Deviations due to the client require client approval (an Exception-to-Process (EtP) or ESIS RAL). Medium SAP0567 Security 03 Default accounts have been disabled, renamed, or password changed - The Sybase System administrator account “sa” needs to be secured after installation. It has a blank or NULL password upon install. A user logged in as \"sa\" can use any database on Adaptive Server, including master, with full privileges. Change the password away from the default. This also applies to any other default user ids such as “guest”. The Sybase system administrator should log in to Adaptive Server as \"sa\" and set a password: $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/bin/isql -Usa -P -Sserver_name 1> sp_password null, new_password 2> go where: null – is the default password. Determine and disable if there is a guest user account: exec sp_helpuser guest Or: exec sp_displaylogin \"guest\". Compliace is expected. High Even though this is a 'High' item, it would take multiple deviations to fail the platform. The reason is the auditor treats all parts of this matrix item together. So the population is larger. There is no set number because there is no set number of instances sampled. SAP0587 04 The system is configured to ensure password complexity (#): - Sybase supports password complexity as noted in the table below. The later versions of Sybase will have more extensive options. The attached table shows password complexity options according to the CIS Benchmark for Sybase ASE. - To configure password complexity: exec sp_configure 'minimum password length', 8 exec sp_configure 'check password for digit', 1 To verify, issue commands like: exec sp_configure 'minimum password length' exec sp_configure 'check password for digit' exec sp_passwordpolicy 'list' - Deviations due to the client require client approval (an Exception-to-Process (EtP) or ESIS RAL). High SAP0587 Security 04a b. Min alpha (ESIS=1) High SAP0587 Security 04b c. Min length (ESIS=8) High SAP0587 Security 04c d. Min other (ESIS=1) High One or more inappropriate password expirations not set can fail a platform. This is highly dependent on compensating controls, i.e. was there a last login during the audit period. SAP0587 Security 05 Password Expiration (ESIS<91) - Sybase supports password aging at the global level, user level or per role. Password expiration is disabled by default. Password aging should be set to 90 days or better. To configure password expiration: exec sp_configure 'systemwide password expiration', 90 To verify: exec sp_configure 'systemwide password expiration' - Deviations due to the client require client approval (an Exception-to-Process (EtP) or ESIS RAL).  SAP0568 06 Privileged Access (#): - System administrator access is required for privileged tasks including updating system tables and starting and shutting down database servers. Ensure system table updates are restricted. This setting is enabled by default. To configure password expiration: exec sp_configure 'allow updates to system tables', 0 To verify: exec sp_configure 'allow updates to system tables' Ensure starting/shutting down the database server is restricted to the sa_role. Verify users that have an sa_role. Issue the following query: select suser_name(slr.suid) as 'login', ssr.name as 'role' from sysloginroles slr, syssrvroles ssr where ssr.name ='sa_role' and ssr.srid = slr.srid .

SAP0572 07 Verify that the following log files exist (Y/N): - Sybase auditing should be enabled and configured for logging all database logins and errors at a minimum. It is disabled by default. See the Sybase System Administrator Guide on configuring audit. 1. Installing the audit function is a multi-step process: 2. Create the auditing devices. 3. Create the audit database. 4. Run the installsecurity script to create the database tables 5. Restart the database server Consider performance issues like keeping audit tables on separate devices, tables should have a threshold procedure, the audit queue size may need adjusting and use the ‘suspend audit when device is full’ option. To configure database auditing: exec sp_configure “auditing”,1 To configure database logon events: exec sp_configure 'log audit logon failure', 1 exec sp_configure 'log audit logon success', 1 or: exec sp_audit 'login', 'all', 'all', 'on' To configure database error events: exec sp_audit 'errors', 'all', 'all', 'on' To verify the configuration: exec sp_displayaudit or: exec sp_configure 'auditing' To verify proper permissions, i.e. readonly: exec sp_helprotect audit data Also ensure the main database OS log exists and with proper permissions, i.e. no world write, example: ls –l SYBASE_MAS.log Medium SAP0572 Software 07a a.

CIO’s struggle to meet these demands because of the challenges in designing and delivery of technical innovation Finding the talent to deliver upon these changes. And the complexity of transformation both in a technical and business sense to adopt to new methodologies App Modernization – 40% of the contracts will sit with Apps Management contracts.

Largest Telecomms company in Australia 17.7 retail mobile services 4.9 million fixed lines 3.6 m retail broadband services Objective ~ Telstra moved to Lean/Agile operating model to drive higher velocity for the business and lower overall operating costs We had 104+ applications in Telstra ~ we took an iterative approach. For each application 1 week assessment, 2 weeks training on DevOps and product backlog creation/cutover on the 4th week. Teams were ramped up to operate in DevOps model following transition. We then ran 2 pilot sprints of 2 weeks each to try out new way of working and plug gaps. Training and coaching was key success factor. We adopted multiple training methods followed like Classroom sessions, Role plays, Dojos, workshops, Games, floor events, role specific sessions, Quizzes for our teams (~50+ Onshore and 384+ Offshore) and Telstra product owners (~ close to 30). Sizeable efforts spent on training and ramping up teams to take on DevOps way of working. It was intense 90 days transition…met our transition objectives by maintaining Delivery tranquility. Team delivered over 100+ releases (13 Major) while transitioning to DevOps model. Formed feature teams delivering both Dev and Ops work. Feature teams adopted the proven Scrum process for development work and Kanban process for operations work. It was purely capacity based model so Telstra product owners drove the prioritization of the work and work assignment.

This is common practice in the market place. This is due to CIOs facing pressure from the business to deliver new features, provide competitive differentiation and modernise. These initiatives are expensive and lead to the need to compress the basic run budget. CIO’s struggle to meet these demands because of the challenges in designing and delivery of technical innovation Finding the talent to deliver upon these changes. And the complexity of transformation both in a technical and business sense to adopt to new methodologies App Modernization – 40% of the contracts will sit with Apps Management contracts.

A single, traditional, apps management service does not adequately satisfy the faster paced business demands of the customer centric applications. Fast pace customer facing apps need a more agile approach, customer centric monitoring and a combined Dev / Ops delivery model. Slower paced applications can be supported using more traditional apps management techniques on a break-fix basis. The “Grey Apps” – sit between the two. Some will have a more rapid pace of change than others. The key message is that services need to be tailored to the needs of the business. GREEN can also be categorised as: Front office Apps of engagement Customer facing BLUE: Back-office Systems of record Employee facing Internal GREY: Business-enablement Systems of differentiation Supplier engagement 11 SaaS apps increasingly applied to horizontal functions – e.g. HR, CRM Run only Packaged Vertical apps are customized & integrated – e.g. Policy / Claims Mgt. for Insurance Run & Maintain with retrospective automation to optimize costs Custom apps are developed for front-end customer engagement Dev/Ops agile delivery with pro-active embedded automation for zero ops Typical Industry approach Highest potential support costs Lowest support costs DXC Proprietary and Confidential DXC Proprietary and Confidential 12 Offering overview Offering description DXC Application Service Automation – powered by Bionix™ Case Study Example 13 © 2019 DXC Technology Company © 2019 DXC Technology Company Sales Guidance: Ideally tailor the slide with numbers: e.g. Savings of $20m / 5 years on the left Delivering Business Transformation of $20m on the right  © 2019 DXC Technology Company  Application Management A Tier 1 service for cohesive management of complex application portfolios, delivering rapid change & optimized stability through proven automation powered by DXC Bionix™.

Largest Telecomms company in Australia 17.7 retail mobile services 4.9 million fixed lines 3.6 m retail broadband services Objective ~ Telstra moved to Lean/Agile operating model to drive higher velocity for the business and lower overall operating costs We had 104+ applications in Telstra ~ we took an iterative approach. For each application 1 week assessment, 2 weeks training on DevOps and product backlog creation/cutover on the 4th week. Teams were ramped up to operate in DevOps model following transition. We then ran 2 pilot sprints of 2 weeks each to try out new way of working and plug gaps. Training and coaching was key success factor. We adopted multiple training methods followed like Classroom sessions, Role plays, Dojos, workshops, Games, floor events, role specific sessions, Quizzes for our teams (~50+ Onshore and 384+ Offshore) and Telstra product owners (~ close to 30). Sizeable efforts spent on training and ramping up teams to take on DevOps way of working. It was intense 90 days transition…met our transition objectives by maintaining Delivery tranquility. Team delivered over 100+ releases (13 Major) while transitioning to DevOps model. Formed feature teams delivering both Dev and Ops work. Feature teams adopted the proven Scrum process for development work and Kanban process for operations work. It was purely capacity based model so Telstra product owners drove the prioritization of the work and work assignment.

Excellence    © 2019 DXC Technology Company 66 A foundation built on core values Teamwork Leadership should derive from skill, not title; our CLEAR Values align teammates from/across all layers and levels Immediacy of Media/News With little time to get it right, an employee’s first instinct should be informed by our CLEAR Values Virtual Workers Our CLEAR Values represent common standards that unite a global, increasingly virtual DXC community Diversity and Globalization Our CLEAR Values smooth otherwise obvious differences in age, gender, religion and custom/heritage Rising Use of Strategic Partners Our CLEAR Values drive uniformity in our dealings with customers, suppliers and competitors Entrepreneurship With encouragement for risk-taking and innovation comes the need to act responsibly and with integrity     © 2019 DXC Technology Company DXC Technology’s CLEAR Values are an important competitive differentiator and intangible driver of our company’s success. They define all we do and who we are; our CLEAR Values are the distinguishing hallmarks of DXC performance and reputation. DXC clients and business partners the world over know that our leaders have long committed to a strong culture of ethics and performance with integrity — a culture in which the way we achieve our objectives and conduct ourselves matters as much as, if not more than, the results. Consequently, ours is a proud heritage marked by the experience of clients and partners who, over many years and through thick and thin, can point to circumstances in which the commitment of our teams to integrity and values was a reassuring difference-maker that deepened trust and, occasionally, restored confidence. So, we know from real experience that values-driven performance with integrity defines our today and secures our tomorrow. In many ways, the CLEAR Values are the “special sauce” of DXC. We depend on our values to harmonize interactions with each other and among our clients, business partners, and competitors. The CLEAR Values unify us in all organizations and worksites, and link us as one, whether we’re physically co-located or members of virtual teams. As well, our CLEAR Values align us to objectives as effective teammates without regard for titles or differences in workplace responsibility. Also important is the effect our values have on decision-making and personal responsibility. We trust our CLEAR Values to inform employee instincts in fast-moving circumstances when there’s little time to “get it right.” Likewise, they ground our actions in responsibility and integrity when risk taking and innovation are required. Indeed, we believe decisions and actions taken consistent with our CLEAR Values are time and again the right decisions, and always good business. At DXC, integrity, culture, and these CLEAR Values will remain vitally important to us. Our people know there are not any circumstances in which it is appropriate to abandon these ideals. We believe they drive an enduring confidence and trust that secures our industry leadership. So, we embrace a culture of integrity and these CLEAR Values with a mind to far exceed minimal compliance standards, always and everywhere. At DXC Technology, we expect and accept nothing less. 67 Thank you 68 DXC_P322 March 2017 © 2019 DXC Technology Company © 2019 DXC Technology Company 68 Appendix © 2019 DXC Technology Company © 2019 DXC Technology Company Industrialized delivery model framework Client-centric workforce Analytics-driven production system Globally governed, regionally managed Global Delivery Network Leveraging data-driven analytics and AI to provide improved performance insights and drive immediate and continual improvements.

A single, traditional, apps management service does not adequately satisfy the faster paced business demands of the customer centric applications. Fast pace customer facing apps need a more agile approach, customer centric monitoring and a combined Dev / Ops delivery model. Slower paced applications can be supported using more traditional apps management techniques on a break-fix basis. The “Grey Apps” – sit between the two. Some will have a more rapid pace of change than others. The key message is that services need to be tailored to the needs of the business.

Largest Telecomms company in Australia 17.7 retail mobile services 4.9 million fixed lines 3.6 m retail broadband services Objective ~ Telstra moved to Lean/Agile operating model to drive higher velocity for the business and lower overall operating costs We had 104+ applications in Telstra ~ we took an iterative approach. For each application 1 week assessment, 2 weeks training on DevOps and product backlog creation/cutover on the 4th week. Teams were ramped up to operate in DevOps model following transition. We then ran 2 pilot sprints of 2 weeks each to try out new way of working and plug gaps. Training and coaching was key success factor. We adopted multiple training methods followed like Classroom sessions, Role plays, Dojos, workshops, Games, floor events, role specific sessions, Quizzes for our teams (~50+ Onshore and 384+ Offshore) and Telstra product owners (~ close to 30). Sizeable efforts spent on training and ramping up teams to take on DevOps way of working. It was intense 90 days transition…met our transition objectives by maintaining Delivery tranquility. Team delivered over 100+ releases (13 Major) while transitioning to DevOps model. Formed feature teams delivering both Dev and Ops work. Feature teams adopted the proven Scrum process for development work and Kanban process for operations work. It was purely capacity based model so Telstra product owners drove the prioritization of the work and work assignment.

Excellence    © 2019 DXC Technology Company 66 A foundation built on core values Teamwork Leadership should derive from skill, not title; our CLEAR Values align teammates from/across all layers and levels Immediacy of Media/News With little time to get it right, an employee’s first instinct should be informed by our CLEAR Values Virtual Workers Our CLEAR Values represent common standards that unite a global, increasingly virtual DXC community Diversity and Globalization Our CLEAR Values smooth otherwise obvious differences in age, gender, religion and custom/heritage Rising Use of Strategic Partners Our CLEAR Values drive uniformity in our dealings with customers, suppliers and competitors Entrepreneurship With encouragement for risk-taking and innovation comes the need to act responsibly and with integrity     © 2019 DXC Technology Company DXC Technology’s CLEAR Values are an important competitive differentiator and intangible driver of our company’s success. They define all we do and who we are; our CLEAR Values are the distinguishing hallmarks of DXC performance and reputation. DXC clients and business partners the world over know that our leaders have long committed to a strong culture of ethics and performance with integrity — a culture in which the way we achieve our objectives and conduct ourselves matters as much as, if not more than, the results. Consequently, ours is a proud heritage marked by the experience of clients and partners who, over many years and through thick and thin, can point to circumstances in which the commitment of our teams to integrity and values was a reassuring difference-maker that deepened trust and, occasionally, restored confidence. So, we know from real experience that values-driven performance with integrity defines our today and secures our tomorrow. In many ways, the CLEAR Values are the “special sauce” of DXC. We depend on our values to harmonize interactions with each other and among our clients, business partners, and competitors. The CLEAR Values unify us in all organizations and worksites, and link us as one, whether we’re physically co-located or members of virtual teams. As well, our CLEAR Values align us to objectives as effective teammates without regard for titles or differences in workplace responsibility. Also important is the effect our values have on decision-making and personal responsibility. We trust our CLEAR Values to inform employee instincts in fast-moving circumstances when there’s little time to “get it right.” Likewise, they ground our actions in responsibility and integrity when risk taking and innovation are required. Indeed, we believe decisions and actions taken consistent with our CLEAR Values are time and again the right decisions, and always good business. At DXC, integrity, culture, and these CLEAR Values will remain vitally important to us. Our people know there are not any circumstances in which it is appropriate to abandon these ideals. We believe they drive an enduring confidence and trust that secures our industry leadership. So, we embrace a culture of integrity and these CLEAR Values with a mind to far exceed minimal compliance standards, always and everywhere. At DXC Technology, we expect and accept nothing less. 67 Thank you 68 DXC_P322 March 2017 © 2019 DXC Technology Company © 2019 DXC Technology Company 68 Appendix © 2019 DXC Technology Company © 2019 DXC Technology Company Industrialized delivery model framework Client-centric workforce Analytics-driven production system Globally governed, regionally managed Global Delivery Network Leveraging data-driven analytics and AI to provide improved performance insights and drive immediate and continual improvements.

App Profile: Back office; commoditized services; lowest pace of change Customer Objectives: Standardize; lower cost; stability; Apps Approach: Move to packaged SaaS applications Services should be matched to the customer’s apps portfolio, their objectives & business drivers © 2019 DXC Technology Company Different categories of applications need to be supported and managed in accordance with customers objectives. A single, traditional, apps management service does not adequately satisfy the faster paced business demands of the customer centric applications. Fast pace customer facing apps need a more agile approach, customer centric monitoring and a combined Dev / Ops delivery model. Slower paced applications can be supported using more traditional apps management techniques on a break-fix basis. The “Grey Apps” – sit between the two. Some will have a more rapid pace of change than others. The key message is that services need to be tailored to the needs of the business.
