          "page_body": "DXC Threat Hunting and Incident Response is designed to ensure that the client's enterprise has 24x7x365 access to highly skilled security professionals to investigate breaches. DXC incident response advisors work closely with the client's organization to build a collaborative incident plan and jointly define escalation procedures. When a top-tier incident occurs, all required participants are quickly integrated into the response. Minimized breach impact. Quickly identify the extent of the compromise.  Reduced brand damage. Ensure timely insight into breaches so the client’s organization can accurately communicate the severity of the compromise and reduce the uncertainty and misinformation that typically follows a high-profile  breach.  Reduced regulatory fines. By demonstrating optimized response capabilities, the client can minimize potential regulatory fines resulting from breaches.  Flexible resources based on usage. Access to DXC’s resources is related to usage. The client’s organization can purchase a monthly allotment of response hours and draw upon them as needed throughout the month. If the allocation  is not fully consumed, the hours can be carried forward throughout the contract year. After the tenth month of the service year, up to 50 percent of any unused retainer hours can be transferred to other DXC advisory or security diagnostic services,  depending on the commercial package the client chooses.

The challenge is to find a partner who can offer the best pricing, terms and conditions, and depth and breadth of ServiceNow experience. DXC Technology offers two options to maximize the value of ServiceNow licenses—a traditional resell model and an innovative lease model. Each has a strong value proposition for clients. When organizations decide to make a strategic investment in the ServiceNow platform, they're looking for the best pricing, desirable terms and an optimized license bundle to minimize underuse. In addition, clients often select the same partner for both transition and transformation services. Few partners can deliver in all these areas. DXC can—we are the top competitive ServiceNow partner in delivering on those needs. Pricing and terms—DXC leverages its scale across enterprise customers to offer the lowest price and additional flexibility in terms and conditions compared to other partners, or even ServiceNow itself.  Phased license rollout —DXC has the flexibility to strategically plan a solution that rolls out licenses in phases, potentially saving the client hundreds of thousands of dollars over the contract term.  End-to-end services—DXC's ServiceNow practice represents ServiceNow's longest standing partnership, with thousands of successful customer projects over 10 years. DXC offers a one-stop shop for customers: advisory services, licenses, implementation and ongoing managed services.  Maximized value and minimized waste—ServiceNow and other resellers require clients to purchase all licenses upfront, although they may not be needed until months later. DXC allows clients to phase license investments, thereby delivering significant savings.  DXC purchasing power—DXC's volume and scale allow significantly lower pricing than an individual client can obtain, offering substantially lower pricing than any other reseller—including ServiceNow itself, in many cases.  One vendor agreement—By providing end-to-end ServiceNow solutions, we help customers shorten the procurement process and avoid multiple MSA negotiations with separate vendors.  More SKUs than any other partner—DXC can sell more ServiceNow license SKUs than any other partner, even more than the ServiceNow direct sales team can. Our (retroactive) access to the best license entitlement bundles ensures the best-fit scope and budget based on each client's environment.  Professional services and certifications—DXC's ServiceNow practice is ServiceNow's longest standing partnership, with 10 years of implementation experience and one of the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry. 3,000+ successful ServiceNow implementations Highest customer satisfaction score of all globally certified partners Hundreds of ServiceNow license clients through both of DXC's offering spanning the Global footprint Negotiation power to gain the most sizable clients to go to DXC versus any other partner or ServiceNow direct #1 ServiceNow ecosystem provider Highest customer satisfaction score of all globally certified partners Recognized with multiple top awards from ServiceNow Regional sales and delivery presence across most of the globe Whether clients are considering a standard ITSM replacement or embarking on an end-to-end digital transformation, ServiceNow is the dominant solution in the market. The foundation of any client's investment in ServiceNow is licensing for the platform, along with additional modules or capabilities. There are hundreds of ServiceNow partners globally, which creates an extremely complex landscape for clients who want a single partner to procure their licenses as well as deliver their professional services. DXC offers an industry-leading set of solutions with the competitive pricing and flexibility demanded by enterprise clients. We offer the lowest pricing, most flexible contract terms, and significant influence on ServiceNow's roadmap for platform enhancements.

Transformation—Delivering a complete digital transformation for an earthquake ravaged city, DXC designed, developed and implemented an integrated solution based on SAP C/4HANA.

In the digital world, these interactions can happen anywhere the customer deems convenient, and via any number of channels. The digital world and customer experience expectations have been evolving for over 20 years, however, many organizations are still operating with: Disparate customer data silos Heavily customized in-house or previous generation platforms that are unscalable Lack of integration capability No internal capability to lead digital transformation No personalized capability to have meaningful interactions with their customers, regardless of channel These and many other challenges render an organization incapable of delivering omnichannel interactions that aim to consistently deliver contextually relevant and personalized experiences, to connect processes to customer journeys, or for architecting and scaling with new technologies that enable organizations to innovate and adapt to meet changing business and customer needs.

Transformation—Delivering a complete digital transformation for an earthquake ravaged city, DXC designed, developed and implemented an integrated solution based on SAP C/4HANA. The solution focused on streamlining processes and empowering customers to self-serve. DXC delivered this by reducing the number of systems to a single system for handling request processes and applications whilst integrating the solution with GIS and ERP software to ensure consistency of experience.

Minimum viable product (MVP) was delivered on time, in weeks instead of months, and within budget. Value—DXC helped a book retailer implement a new ecommerce marketplace that would grow to represent 15% of the company's revenues and redefine the user experience. DXC created a flexible meta-catalog and worked on a tool system that involved the integration of thousands of sellers and several million products. The transformation project resulted in a 22% uplift in customer conversions and reduced time to market for innovations by 75%.

It is more than just commerce, marketing or customer relationship management. It is the totality of interactions throughout the journey a customer experiences with an organization. In the digital world, these interactions can happen anywhere the customer deems convenient, and via any number of channels. The digital world and customer experience expectations have been evolving for over 20 years, however, many organizations are still operating with: Disparate customer data silos Heavily customized in-house or previous generation platforms that are unscalable Lack of integration capability No internal capability to lead digital transformation No personalized capability to have meaningful interactions with their customers, regardless of channel These and many other challenges render an organization incapable of delivering omnichannel interactions that aim to consistently deliver contextually relevant and personalized experiences, to connect processes to customer journeys, or for architecting and scaling with new technologies that enable organizations to innovate and adapt to meet changing business and customer needs.

This resulted in a 12x reduction of deployment time, enabling faster product launch than competitors. Business agility–DXC used Agile practices for a law enforcement agency to manage changing requirements, completing 4x the original requirements with 50 percent of the original estimated budget. High-quality, market-relevant solutions–For a European bank and insurance broker, DXC used scaled Agile and DevOps, resulting in an 85 percent reduction in regression issues and with minimal defects reported by 700 users in the first week after go-live. Adaptive automation–We develop the most effective client-specific automation solution that maximizes quality and efficiency and is easily deployed through code. Our expertise in API-centric integration enables us to leverage your existing environment and maximize ROI. Human-centric design–Design thinking and user experience practices are embedded in our methodologies. This assists in operationalizing innovation and delivering accessible, hyper personal solutions to maximize the adoption, use, and relevance of cross-platform solutions Industrialized continuous delivery–Our industrialized delivery model employs the best talent, methodologies, tools, and industry assets in multiple geographies. This capability can be scaled and distributed to effectively align with business cycles and strategies. Continuous testing, end-to-end quality management, and collective ownership of security through the Agile/DevSecOps pipeline ensure continuous delivery of high-quality and secure solutions. Accelerated transformation–We use a proven and repeatable approach to transformation to quickly jump start and accelerate digitalization. We leverage the latest technology and apply Lean, Agile, and DevSecOps components appropriately through transformation stages with careful consideration of your existing environment. Responsive governance–Value management dashboards that provide predictive and prescriptive analytics complement our portfolio, program, and project governance processes to amplify feedback, monitor value delivery, and provide guidance for relentless improvement and continuous business alignment. Secure by design–DXC addresses application security early and continuously through every step of the lifecycle to develop a more secure application validated through our security testing services. Our approach reduces risk while enabling us to deliver more secure applications faster and more efficiently.

          "page_body": "This offering combines market-leading archive solutions with expertise services to select and move finalized data from its source into the archive. Archiving Services enable a range of benefits for clients including: reducing data storage and compliance costs, retiring legacy applications, minimizing personal data, increasing the value of inactive or unused business data, ensuring compliance with changing regulations, and protecting valuable information assets. DXC‘s archiving methodology covers a wide range of data types—such as email and office files and data from business applications—and allows businesses across all industries to transform static information into a dynamic data storehouse. Organizations feel squeezed between rising data storage spending, compliance costs, and increasing government regulations. It is a complex task to manage the retention and disposition of a rapidly growing volume and variety of information, to mitigate risk, maintain service levels for key applications, and to decommission outdated ones. Archiving Services enable customers to take control of their information, manage it as a business asset, and increase their competitive advantage. Retire legacy applications—Archiving Services have enabled a client to shutdown a datacenter and save $23M with a return on invest of 1,300% by retiring 500 applications. Reduce storage costs—Clients take control of business files and messages, freeing up large quantities of expensive storage, and enabling them to actively manage the disposition of outdated content, resulting not only in storage savings of roughly 200TB for a $15B manufacturing company, but also reduced litigation expenses. Act on data privacy regulation—Based on DXC Archiving Services, we have enabled customers to achieve compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar global legislation by cross system treatment of data including provable disposition of non-compliant personal data, avoiding potential multi-billion dollar fines for GDPR non-compliance. DXC expertise—Skilled DXC archiving experts help clients to achieve archiving results—to analyze data sources, set up and execute archiving in the best way for the data, manage large numbers of concurrent archiving projects effectively, and use the archive skillfully to derive additional business value from stored data. One archive for all data—Whether the material includes messages, office files, data from SAP or non-SAP systems, or other sources, a comprehensive archive for all data simplifies operations, avoids compliance risks, and augments the value of archived information by the ability to correlate it. Flexibility—We offer many options to adapt an archive to your service needs. These include flexible options to access archived data for almost any purpose, a large number of connectors to archive from almost any application or repository, and flexible deployment options: on premise, traditional managed services, or as-a-service delivery. Market leading solutions—DXC has strong partnerships and extensive implementation experience with Micro Focus and Data Migration Services, whose archiving and related solutions are highly rated by analysts. Global delivery capability—With 95 Data Centers, 9,200 Analytics Consultants, >20 Global and Regional Delivery Centers and 20+ years of experience, DXC truly has a global reach. Analysts continue to place the software solutions DXC works with as leader in archiving and related areas. Our software partners are market leaders in Enterprise Information Archiving, Structured Data Archiving and more DXC has 95 Data Centers, 9,200 Analytics consultants, >20 Global and Regional Delivery Centers and 20+ years of experience Organizations are squeezed by rising data cost, tightening compliance demands, and heightened public awareness of data breaches. Many companies also have a difficult time envisioning their information as a business asset. The pressures underlying data management leads to hoarding behavior, which exacerbates the concerns involving data: hoarding entails a compliance risk and exposes companies to increased litigation cost and data leakage risk. As a result, organizations lack control over their data, unable to derive valuable insights from it, and unable to mitigate compliance risk.

Services range from client-dedicated installations to highly leveraged, shared environments. We deliver global services remotely to client sites or DXC leveraged data centers. A flexible service design offers base services including mainframe and storage platform, operating system, operational support tools, and 24x7 management. ITIL-based service management enables clients to meet operational industry standards and our stringent security policies. Optional features include site migration, transformation, non-base software support, and flexible pricing based on used or installed million instructions per second (MIPS). We help clients optimize mainframe service costs and enhance productivity by delivering the management expertise, processes, and tools to scale Mainframe infrastructure. This allows clients to meet organizational and market changes without incurring capital investment. Performance improvement — A public sector agency gained operational and performance benefits from a new platform-as-a-service that improved transaction volumes ten-fold and response times by 97%. The platform also  reduced the risk of outages and service disruptions resulting from additional capacity.  Savings — A large multinational automotive manufacturer selected DXC for a multi-year infrastructure outsourcing contract to lower total cost of ownership by up to 30% with less risk than other competitors. Fast provisioning resulted  in a savings of $1.3 million.  Growth and scalability — DXC helped a major insurance company grow from a regional to national provider by enabling stable applications, mainframe operations, and resource flexibility. The result was a robust, flexible technology  environment that supports the company’s growth goals and reduced IT costs by 50% in five years.  Expertise — Offers in-depth z/OS, IMS, DB2, CICS, and MQ-Series experience. DXC has a global pool of talent consisting of on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore resources. Our talent comes from companies that have previously outsourced for HPE, EDS, and CSC and from talent hired from the external market. Our skills are organized and trained in a manner that allows efficiency and constant training through our Academies. In addition to our managed-services delivery organization, DXC has additional consultancy skills in Application modernization and digital transformation, performance engineering, systems management, and emerging technologies such as BigData and Analytics, Cognitive, Security and Compliance and Cloud/Hybrid Computing. Success — Global reach with many years of Infrastructure and Application Mainframe experience. DXC manages 720,000+ mainframe MIPS for 160+ clients in 14 countries; 150+ Mainframe Application Management clients; Conducted over 300 successful mainframe migrations to date. Responsiveness — Supports z/OS, TPF, zLinux, VM/VSE, non-IBM, and 24x7 operations. Thought leadership — Uses DXC knowledge to reposition IT as a strategic investment, rather than an operational cost. Innovation — Pioneered the first mainframe outsourcing model in 1962; established the first regional datacenter in 1970 and European data centers in 1984.  DXC is focused on client business objectives and has a mass that is hard to ignore. It offers a full spectrum of DSO/HIMS capabilities and a global footprint to deliver on hybrid infrastructure services – legacy, private cloud and public cloud.6 DXC operates 33 Mainframes in ASIA/Pacific, comprising roughly 144,000 MIPS in the Asia/Pacific region. Of this, 109,000 are traditional IBM mainframe MIPS, 6,000 are cloud-based IBM MIPS and 29,000 are MIPS from non-IBM mainframes. Reference clients report DXC's mainframe services are very good. DXC offers both traditional managed mainframe services and the ability to run mainframe on the cloud.7 The combined strength of CSC and HPE ES means DXC has more than 95 data centers, more the 250 leading partners and more than 14 strategic partners. With all this, DXC has capabilities and global footprint to offer a full spectrum of hybrid infrastructure services – legacy, private cloud and public cloud.8 Reference clients praise DXC for its global scale and resource pool, and for its technical capabilities and strategic vendor relationships.

It takes ongoing investment in software, hardware, facilities, and  support. In addition, capacity must be readily available to handle peak periods and unexpected growth. As the volume of transactions is increasing with more consumer-driven demands for information, more and more CIOs/CTOs are looking for someone to  help them navigate these infrastructure challenges.

To address the expected growth in demand from individuals to know what of their personal details are held by organizations following the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in May 2018, DXC has developed a “Personal Details  Report” that can be run on demand to extract relevant data from the core Oracle applications. This is extendible to include data held in user defined fields, custom tables and industry-specific or specialized modules within the wider suite of  applications, subject to engaging with DXC’s Oracle Consulting and Advisory services. The introduction of GDPR in May 2018 has placed a burden on all organizations holding or processing personal data to demonstrate that these details are accurate and only being held for the purposes to which the individual consented. GDPR compliance support — DXC’s “Personal Details Report” contributes the demonstration of regulation compliance by showing that a process has been put in place and that a high volume of requests for personal data can be responded to within 30 days. Automation and standardization — Automation of reporting process produces consistent results and minimizes the amount of manual intervention required to produce the reports, as well as reducing the need to recruit additional staff to support the new regulations. Rapid and quick reporting — Running large numbers of reports during working hours can impact system performance as it copes with high traffic volumes across the network and then processing power required to generate the reports. Scheduling this activity for off peak periods minimizes these impacts but leaves the option to run on demand if/when required.

          "page_body": "DXC Advisory for ServiceNow provides clients with options to manage and govern their ServiceNow platform to optimize use and value. There are three products that leverage DXC's expertise and holistic approach to ServiceNow: Strategic Platform Governance — DXC establishes a governance function specifically to oversee the strategic direction, expansion and alignment of the ServiceNow platform enterprise and IT goals, while ensuring key stakeholders from across the enterprise can communicate their needs as the platform expands. This work is done within 10 weeks and includes articulation of platform policies as well as go live support for initial governance meetings.  Platform Change Strategy — Clients planning major implementations or additions to the ServiceNow platform benefit from DXC's assistance in forecasting organizational change management challenges and determining mitigation strategies before the project begins.  Platform Health Assessment — Clients often need external examination of their ServiceNow platform to identify performance and functional issues and prescribed mitigation measures. The Crawl-Walk-Run recommendations provide clients with a tailored, structured program for resolving the technical debt and restoring the platform to health. Following any implementation, ServiceNow clients must maintain, manage, direct and govern, and expand the ServiceNow platform. Addressing these challenges internally requires expertise in best practices that may not be readily available internally or difficult to free up from day-to-day running of the platform. Benefit realization — All DXC Advisory products for ServiceNow contribute to assurance that the benefits desired from the ServiceNow platform are clear and communicated throughout the enterprise due to appropriate governance and assessment of organizational change management needs. Platform adoption — Ensuring a positive user experience means more than getting the correct requirements and configuration. Our offering pursues a conversation on how delivering services using the platform ensures a positive user experience and drives adoption. Technical debt avoidance and correction — The accumulation of errors or problems in scripting, configuration and development can build up to degrade performance, make maintenance and support more and more time consuming and diminish user satisfaction with the platform. DXC can step in to identify the issues and determine the mitigations necessary.  Experience — DXC has been the trusted advisor to Fortune 100 companies. We have helped clients to create their digital roadmaps for enterprise service management.We help clients optimize and bring efficiency to the day-to-day operation of their ServiceNow platform, increasing their ROI.  Track record — DXC is the largest globally certified ServiceNow partner, with over4,000 implementations and the most ServiceNow certified consultants.

DXC believes ina practical approach to enterprise service management consulting that focuses on business outcomes.  Holistic approach — DXC is a one-stop shop for all ServiceNow needs - strategy,advisory services, licensing, implementation services, support, guidance and maintenance - something few of our competitors can match.  Technology — As a leading services provider, DXC offers more ServiceNow digital transformation services than any other provider. Services can either be bundled together or pursued independently to target specific customer problems.  Over 4,000 successful ServiceNow implementations  Highest customer satisfaction score of all globally certified partners  Over 1,000 ServiceNow professionals  9+ years of ServiceNow experience Organizations that adopt ServiceNow as their enterprise service management platform invest significantly in implementation, licensing and ongoing support and maintenance.

DXC Advisory for ServiceNow provides clients with options to manage and govern their ServiceNow platform to optimize use and value. There are three products that leverage DXC's expertise and holistic approach to ServiceNow: Strategic Platform Governance — DXC establishes a governance function specifically to oversee the strategic direction, expansion and alignment of the ServiceNow platform enterprise and IT goals, while ensuring key stakeholders from across the enterprise can communicate their needs as the platform expands. This work is done within 10 weeks and includes articulation of platform policies as well as go live support for initial governance meetings.  Platform Change Strategy — Clients planning major implementations or additions to the ServiceNow platform benefit from DXC's assistance in forecasting organizational change management challenges and determining mitigation strategies before the project begins.  Platform Health Assessment — Clients often need external examination of their ServiceNow platform to identify performance and functional issues and prescribed mitigation measures. The Crawl-Walk-Run recommendations provide clients with a tailored, structured program for resolving the technical debt and restoring the platform to health. Following any implementation, ServiceNow clients must maintain, manage, direct and govern, and expand the ServiceNow platform. Addressing these challenges internally requires expertise in best practices that may not be readily available internally or difficult to free up from day-to-day running of the platform. Benefit realization — All DXC Advisory products for ServiceNow contribute to assurance that the benefits desired from the ServiceNow platform are clear and communicated throughout the enterprise due to appropriate governance and assessment of organizational change management needs.

The solution greatly reduces or eliminates recovery time in the event of unplanned downtime or disaster. Utilizing leveraged or dedicated equipment from data centers geographically separated from clients business operations and supported by DXC's experienced recovery personnel we can help clients manage their business risks and reduce the impact from outages or disasters. An optional service is also available for the recovery of workplace and office environments. DCRS solutions support flexible contracting and invoicing terms, are customizable to meet the clients specific continuity requirements and are delivered from a global network of DXC Recovery Centers. Most enterprises rely on an ecosystem of internal and external systems and data to conduct their business. Users across the value chain are generating unprecedented amounts of data, and their expectation for services that are “always-on, always available” is the expected norm. Data Center Recovery Services provide clients with proactive strategies that are unique for their flexibility, global coverage, and ability to handle today's complex environments. Effective cost-saving recovery—A U.S. public sector agency reduced its IT costs by 20%, improved system availability, and reliability with zero severity 1 or 2 outages, and ensured system redundancy with near-100% network uptime. Optimized recovery times—A manufacturer of water heating systems implemented a cost-effective disaster recovery (DR) solution to protect its IT-enabled business processes and improve DR metrics significantly: recovery time objective (RTO) of 36 hours (previously 5 days), recovery point objective (RPO) of 24 hours, and only one DR rehearsal per year. Audit compliance and risk management—Compliance with stricter banking rules enabled one client to ensure a near zero failure rate, improved access to data, and always-on disaster protection. Data Center Recovery Services provided resumption of customer production environments inline with business requirements and service level objectives.  Customer choice—Solutions aligned to the business criticality of client workloads, supported globally, with the capability to integrate across traditional IT, cloud, and hybrid environments. No competitor provides the breadth of offerings and global reach.  Low risk—Strict limits on the number of clients assigned to the same leveraged asset. Our ratio of clients to hardware is 15:1; our competitors use much higher ratios with many having unlimited assignments. Also, the same equipment is not assigned to multiple clients within a defined geographical radius, something not offered by other providers.  Proven success—Thirty years of experience providing continuity solutions with the successful delivery of over 1000 disaster declarations with 100% success rate.  Market recognition—Gartner has position DXC Technology as a Leader in their report, Magic Quadrant for Data Center Outsourcing and Hybrid Infrastructure Managed Services, North America and Europe (2018).

          "page_body": "As the leading global strategic partner of ServiceNow, DXC Technology provides the deepest industry, process and technical expertise to achieve the most value from clients’ ServiceNow implementations. This deep expertise, along with years of experience  implementing ITAM and ITOM solutions on ServiceNow, has taught us valuable lessons and proven methodologies to make clients’ service asset and configuration management (SACM) journeys succeed. DXC offers a best practice prescriptive roadmap  to maturity as well as flexible service configurations that meet clients’ business requirements. DXC’s robust process collateral, preconfigured technical solutions and collaborative implementation methodology can help clients achieve unprecedented  speed and value for their DXC IT Asset and Operations Management for ServiceNow Implementations. Organizations face growing digital complexity with increased use of cloud and mobile infrastructure platforms. An ever-growing number of connected devices, increased security risks and the need to manage compliance emphasizes the importance of having  mature processes more than ever. DXC IT Asset and Operations Management for ServiceNow provides quick wins as well as a strategic roadmap for addressing these challenges, increasing maturity and harnessing the power of the ServiceNow platform. DXC’s  experience, mature processes and best practice solutions can help transform organizations and lead clients on the path to service transparency and asset optimization. Improve control — DXC helped a pharmaceutical company align ITAM processes across five global regions, rationalize a multitude of data sources and standardize disparate regional data models. This led to streamlined operations,  global reporting transparency and improved governance for processes and data.  Reduce cost — A global retailer was spending staggering amounts on expired lease payments due to poor visibility and process inefficiencies. DXC implemented a solution that enabled proactive tracking of leased assets and contracts  with notification and workflow to drive end-of-life and return processes. At the enterprise level, this solution resulted in significant hard-dollar savings on a recurring basis.  Get compliant — After a recently failed audit, a nationally ranked university addressed their asset management immaturity by rapidly implementing foundational processes along with an integrated CMDB. This provided transparency  into tracking hardware and software, shedding light on non-compliant assets in the environment. DXC’s roadmap to SACM maturity has provided them a guided path for continued growth.  End-to-end capability — DXC’s deep ITAM and ITOM process optimization experience and ServiceNow solutions to bring hard-dollar savings to organizations.  Best practices — DXC has prebuilt best practice processes and solutions provided as part of accelerated implementations or leveraged through bespoke implementations.  Speed — Standard deployment time is reduced by up to 6 months using DXC’s best-in-industry ITAM accelerator, while providing a higher level of process and tool maturity.  Lifecycle — DXC is a one-stop shop for all ServiceNow needs – licensing, implementation services, run support and strategic guidance.  Technology — As a leading IT services provider, DXC offers more IT services #1 ServiceNow ecosystem provider Highest customer satisfaction score of all globally certified partners 3300+ successful ServiceNow implementations 700+ certified implementation consultants Recognized with multiple top awards from ServiceNow Many organizations have some level of IT asset and operations in place but lack the needed maturity to grow and optimize their systems and processes to meet demands of the business at scale. Businesses look to IT to provide more services, faster and cheaper. IT must shift its focus to a clearly defined service-oriented culture. Equally important, IT organizations need visibility into hardware and software components that comprise the service to maximize service availability, accelerate service delivery and optimize costs. Implementation — Project-based engagements typically last 2-6 months, depending on scope of work and additional configurations and integrations. Multi-phase implementations can span 12-18 months or more, depending on breadth of business objectives. Project — Workshops typically occur 4 weeks from SOW signature, but work can begin as soon as ink is on paper with pre-workshop education and preparation activities. Pricing — Variable depending on scope of work and desired mix of onshore/offshore labor. Regional availability — Available globally      CLIENT   REGION   INDUSTRY   CLOSED/WON        Ports of Auckland   ANZ   Logistics/Transportation   Oct 2018      Department of Fire & Emergency Services   ANZ   Government   Oct 2018      PennyMac   Americas   Banking & Capital Markets   Sep 2018      United Technologies (UTC)   Americas   Manufacturing   Mar 2018      British Columbia   Americas   Government   Feb 2018      Ahold-Delhaize   Americas   Retail   Jan 2018      Nestlé SA   NCE   Consumer Industries & Retail   Dec 2017      Nissan   AMEA   Manufacturing   Oct 2017      University of the Pacific   Americas   Public Sector   Oct 2017      Schenker AG   NCE   Logistics/Transportation   Oct 2017      Under Armour   Americas   Retail   Sep 2017      Alamar Foods   AMEA   Consumer Industries & Retail   Aug 2017      Kaiser Foundation Hospitals   Americas   Healthcare   May 2017      Comerica Bank   Americas   Banking & Capital Markets   May 2017      Hershey Company   Americas   Consumer Industries & Retail   May 2017      Molson Coors Brewing   Americas   Consumer Industries & Retail   Apr 2017      Rockwell Collins   Americas   Manufacturing   Mar 2017      Boyd Gaming   Americas   Casinos & Gambling   Oct 2016      Sanofi   NCE   Pharmaceutical   Oct 2016      First Republic Bank   Americas   Banking & Capital Markets   Jul 2016      Nissan UK   UKIIMEA   Manufacturing   May 2016      Ontario Lottery and Gaming (OLG)   Americas   Government   Apr 2016      Wolters Kluwer   Americas   Professional Services   Feb 2016      Nike   Americas   Retail   Feb 2015    Contact the DXC ServiceNow sales and solutioning team to discuss the offering with the client Engage DXC ServiceNow advisory team to help the customer establish a clear vision for their IT Asset and Operations roadmap Reach out to the offering manager to discuss the customer’s needs at a high level and what solutions may be a good fit",

DXC’s  experience, mature processes and best practice solutions can help transform organizations and lead clients on the path to service transparency and asset optimization. Improve control — DXC helped a pharmaceutical company align ITAM processes across five global regions, rationalize a multitude of data sources and standardize disparate regional data models. This led to streamlined operations,  global reporting transparency and improved governance for processes and data.  Reduce cost — A global retailer was spending staggering amounts on expired lease payments due to poor visibility and process inefficiencies. DXC implemented a solution that enabled proactive tracking of leased assets and contracts  with notification and workflow to drive end-of-life and return processes. At the enterprise level, this solution resulted in significant hard-dollar savings on a recurring basis.  Get compliant — After a recently failed audit, a nationally ranked university addressed their asset management immaturity by rapidly implementing foundational processes along with an integrated CMDB. This provided transparency  into tracking hardware and software, shedding light on non-compliant assets in the environment. DXC’s roadmap to SACM maturity has provided them a guided path for continued growth.  End-to-end capability — DXC’s deep ITAM and ITOM process optimization experience and ServiceNow solutions to bring hard-dollar savings to organizations.  Best practices — DXC has prebuilt best practice processes and solutions provided as part of accelerated implementations or leveraged through bespoke implementations.  Speed — Standard deployment time is reduced by up to 6 months using DXC’s best-in-industry ITAM accelerator, while providing a higher level of process and tool maturity.  Lifecycle — DXC is a one-stop shop for all ServiceNow needs – licensing, implementation services, run support and strategic guidance.  Technology — As a leading IT services provider, DXC offers more IT services #1 ServiceNow ecosystem provider Highest customer satisfaction score of all globally certified partners 3300+ successful ServiceNow implementations 700+ certified implementation consultants Recognized with multiple top awards from ServiceNow Many organizations have some level of IT asset and operations in place but lack the needed maturity to grow and optimize their systems and processes to meet demands of the business at scale. Businesses look to IT to provide more services, faster and cheaper. IT must shift its focus to a clearly defined service-oriented culture. Equally important, IT organizations need visibility into hardware and software components that comprise the service to maximize service availability, accelerate service delivery and optimize costs. Implementation — Project-based engagements typically last 2-6 months, depending on scope of work and additional configurations and integrations. Multi-phase implementations can span 12-18 months or more, depending on breadth of business objectives. Project — Workshops typically occur 4 weeks from SOW signature, but work can begin as soon as ink is on paper with pre-workshop education and preparation activities. Pricing — Variable depending on scope of work and desired mix of onshore/offshore labor.

Nearly 80% of the world's financial firms use DXC for security. To keep up with changing business demands, IT and security controls must be agile—fitting business needs—while protecting valuable company resources. The market is expanding and solutions are adapting to fit the current needs. User identities are a fundamental part of controlling access, proving compliance, and managing risk and therefore it is one of most necessary investments organizations make, yet it remains very difficult to manage. Implementation time varies depending on the complexity of the target applications, business workflow and planned phases, which typically take 4 to 9 months. The implementation of the base scope document that supports 4-5 applications (Workday, Active Directory, Office365, Exchange) without complexity is approximately 4 months. The pricing model is based on a one-time implementation charge, while monthly support charges are determined by the number of identities (employees, contractors) and selected service options. Deal sizes range from small volumes (1500) to large environments (>100K identities) Annual deal values can range from $300,000 to $2,000,000 Most contract terms are 36-60 months in duration      CLIENT   REGION   INDUSTRY   CLOSED/WON        Daimler AG   N.C.

Nearly 80% of the world's financial firms use DXC for security. Identity and Access Management (IAM) is one of the most complex areas in security today as it plays a major role in every aspect of the business. User identities are a fundamental part of controlling access, proving compliance, and managing risk and therefore it is one of the most necessary investments organizations make. With the demand for emerging technologies, changes in threat landscape, and staying on top of data access needs, IAM can be difficult to manage and maintain. The way organizations conduct business is changing rapidly. Smartphones and tablets have replaced desktops. Users no longer work at desks; they work from home, a restaurant, and even the supermarket. Users access company applications remotely, and company data is no longer stored on premise, but rather in the cloud. The result: people need access to information from anywhere at any time.

Nearly 80% of the world's financial firms use DXC for security. Identity and Access Management (IAM) is one of the most complex areas in security today as it plays a major role in every aspect of the business. User identities are a fundamental part of controlling access, proving compliance, and managing risk and therefore it is one of the most necessary investments organizations make. With the demand for emerging technologies, changes in threat landscape, and staying on top of data access needs, IAM can be difficult to manage and maintain. The way organizations conduct business is changing rapidly. Smartphones and tablets have replaced desktops. Users no longer work at desks; they work from home, a restaurant, and even the supermarket. Users access company applications remotely, and company data is no longer stored on premise, but rather in the cloud. The result: people need access to information from anywhere at any time.

DXC Threat and Vulnerability Advisory Services DXC Cyber Attack Simulation DXC Vulnerability Scanning DXC Vulnerability Intelligence Service The DXC Ethical Hacking and Vulnerability Management offering identifies, manages and mitigates weaknesses in your defenses before adversaries can attack. It does so by testing an organization's defense posture and developing vulnerability identification plans that uncover weaknesses. Services supporting this offering include Threat and Vulnerability managed and advisory services, Applications Security Services, Cyber Attack Simulation, Vulnerability Management and Vulnerability Intelligence. The difficulty for businesses today is to understand what vulnerabilities are present and how impactful they are to the business. The DXC Ethical Hacking and Vulnerability Management team have a broad set of skills in all areas of security. Our dedicated penetration testing team can deliver anything from targeted penetration testing to a full blown cyber attack assessment. The cyber attack assessment is the first step to identifying where areas of weakness are in a customer's security posture. Use the output of a cyber attack assessment to help in defining an end to end approach to security. DXC can help define and deploy a vulnerability management solution (whether via MSS or advisory) to ensure full visibility of all network connected assets and identify whether any vulnerabilities exist that need to be addressed, and to have a view of any changes within the customer network whether authorized or not. Regional delivery capabilities ensure support your security program within region. Advisory Services DXC delivers expert assessment of the vulnerabilities that open clients' information technology (IT) systems to attackers. Our reach, scale, and access to cutting-edge research enable clients to counter global threats and vulnerabilities. Long-standing clients trust DXC to handle sensitive data according to industry best practices. Prioritize resources—DXC conducted a high-level gap analysis to ISO 27001 standards for a university that experienced over 9000 unknown devices connecting to its network annually. This enabled the university to prioritize IT resources to efficiently achieve its security and business objectives. International scale—When a U.K.-based law firm opened offices in Asia, its small IT department needed help to ensure their data security across the globe. DXC supported the build-out of a secure, global infrastructure. Industry-aligned expertise—DXC enabled a multinational travel reservations company to secure remote and Internet access for 500,000 roaming endpoints, shared kiosks, and handheld devices while achieving cost savings over the legacy network topology. Managed Security Services Proactive protection—Assessments reveal vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities threaten security. Compromised security leads to costly breaches. Avoid this path with Vulnerability Scanning, which proactively prevents threats before they impact clients' operations. Fewer attacks—When combined with Security Monitoring, Vulnerability Scanning automatically correlates security events with scan data. The enriched information provides further context that improves threat management and thwarts future attacks. Visibility and control—With the self-service portal, clients gain an integrated view of their risk posture and 24/7 access to vulnerability and threat data, incidents, and change requests. Reduced complexity—Global security experts help clients understand and prioritize vulnerabilities, control IT risk, and prevent attackers from leaking valuable information. Cost savings—Clients do not incur CapEx costs associated with the purchase and maintenance of an on-premise scanning infrastructure while also avoiding costly breaches due to devastating disruptions. Advisory Services The DXC Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) team is a unique, global team with a vast depth and breadth of experience in security testing, backed by one of the largest information security specialist teams in the world. The TVM practice offers a variety of specialist security services including penetration testing, threat intelligence, and vulnerability management. Ethical hacking experts—Accredited to the highest government and industry standards, including Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST) and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certifications. Local presence, global scale—Specialized security advisors with local presence and knowledge but who can deliver TVM services on a global scale. Vulnerability Management (VM) specialists design, implement, pilot, and operate customized VM solutions. Industry-standards—Industry recognized methodology for handling customer data (ISO 27001, ISO 9001). End-to-end protection—Real-world cyber-attack simulations use multiple methods and tools to exploit weaknesses in people, process, and technology security in the same way that real attackers do. Detailed remediation advice—DXC advisors provide recommendations on how to resolve the identified security issues to ensure that key assets are protected. Managed Security Services Suite of integrated services—DXC offers comprehensive diagnostic, advisory, and managed services, which address all areas of the vulnerability management life cycle including discovery, assessment, reporting, prioritization, remediation, and verification. Prioritized risks—Vulnerability Scanning automatically prioritizes security monitoring incidents and provides additional context during incident analysis and investigation by correlating vulnerability and asset information with threat data. Instant analytics—With VS, clients can search security data, view trends, and track the status of their security posture 24/7 using the unified customer portal, a feature of the next generation MSS platform from which VS is delivered. Understanding of clients' businesses—DXC understands business processes, networks, and IT environments due to deep customer knowledge gleaned from decades of delivering vulnerability and threat management services. Cloud-based value—Clients gain immediate value using DXC's managed cloud service, which enables quick service implementation, unlimited scanning, and flexible, usage-based service options for every business need. DXC has over 3,500 global security advisory, transformation, and managed security services professionals; 40+ years of experience delivering managed security services; and 20 years of experience advising clients. DXC's ethical hacking experts are accredited according to the highest government and industry standards, including the Council for Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST) and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) qualifications. DXC advisors have a minimum of five to ten years of experience at the highest security levels. DXC's proprietary threat intelligence allows us to deliver realistic simulation attacks to emulate the threat actor that concerns your organization most. DXC is vendor agnostic, which means we are not limited by any one technology but can work with best-in-class technology providers to deliver optimal security results. Without a sound security program, companies often experience game-changing losses when vulnerabilities are exposed by hackers or disgruntled employees. The resulting data breaches damage brands and reputations, which are difficult to repair in a highly competitive marketplace. Add lost intellectual property fines and hefty remediation costs, and the results of a cyber attack can be catastrophic. DXC can provide a full breakdown of a business's vulnerabilities and where areas of weak security could be improved. DXC can provide an ongoing vulnerability management program whether part of a managed service or completely bespoke. Let DXC test your security as a dedicated attacker would to identify gaps and help define your managed security requirements.

With data proliferating everywhere, encryption of data at rest and data on the move is a critical data security control in a multi-layer security strategy, to protect against data breaches, data misuse or accidental data loss. Industry standards, regulations and laws prescribe and/or strongly recommend data protection controls such as encryption, de-identification, pseudonymization, and tokenization of data at rest as well as secrets management to centrally manage and store credentials that provide access to sensitive data. Additionally, assuring digital identities, ensuring data integrity, monitoring data activity and securing data communications is a complex problem to solve in today's era of digital transformation. Organizations need help to identify and evaluate their data risks, develop appropriate policies, and implement processes and integrated technical controls to secure their critical data assets and mitigate security and compliance risks. With businesses migrating more production and critical workloads to the public cloud and adopting new application technologies such as containerisation, microservices, serverless computing, managing the data security lifecycle in a cost effective and efficient way is an essential component of any security program.

Global workforces in all environments and industries require instant communication and remote productivity to keep that competitive edge. CISOs have to balance business needs and user productivity with the struggle to stay ahead of the cyber criminals and to protect sensitive data on users' devices. They must also address new and complex issues around compliance and regulations. In addition, the cyber threat landscape is rapidly growing and evolving. Attacks are more sophisticated and stealthy, and come from highly motivated, well-funded adversaries who are focused on acquiring valuable corporate data. Traditional security controls no longer protect against today's targeted attackers—organizations need a new security model that proactively uncovers the most advanced endpoint threats and provides the ability to respond immediately with thorough, dynamic analysis, investigation and remediation. Engagement details depend on selected services : MEP, LDE, MATP or METDR. Number of endpoints is a key cost driver, as well as selected service options and add-ons.

Global workforces in all environments and industries require instant communication and remote productivity to keep that competitive edge. CISOs have to balance business needs and user productivity with the struggle to stay ahead of the cyber criminals and to protect sensitive data on users' devices. They must also address new and complex issues around compliance and regulations. In addition, the cyber threat landscape is rapidly growing and evolving. Attacks are more sophisticated and stealthy, and come from highly motivated, well-funded adversaries who are focused on acquiring valuable corporate data. Traditional security controls no longer protect against today's targeted attackers—organizations need a new security model that proactively uncovers the most advanced endpoint threats and provides the ability to respond immediately with thorough, dynamic analysis, investigation and remediation. Engagement details depend on selected services : MEP, LDE, MATP or METDR. Number of endpoints is a key cost driver, as well as selected service options and add-ons. One time implementation cost + monthly ongoing management cost.

TCO reduction – A major retailer wanted to reduce TCO by gaining insight into expanding retail operations with the SAP HANA® platform, especially for operations and customers. DXC helped reduce TCO by 30% by linking business  outcomes with technology drivers and optimizing end-to-end processes.

ServiceNow ITSM implementations can enable IT to accelerate this revolution. And with resources located all over the world, DXC can deliver anywhere. Transformation – DXC helped one of the largest retail companies to consolidate 15 regional, conflicting IT processes into 4 global processes. Efficiency – A specialty vehicle manufacturer was able eliminate over 36,000 approvals from their processes per year, significantly reducing average SLAs. Speed – An aeronautics engineering company was able to go live 3 months faster using DXC implementation accelerator compared to their original project timeline. Speed — Standard deployment time is reduced by up to 6 months using our best-in-industry ITSM accelerator from traditional methods, while providing a higher level of process and tool maturity.

          "page_body": "DXC Health360 is a cloud-based population health solution that helps healthcare organizations (providers, payers, government) coordinate care and personalize care experiences at every consumer interaction. Built on Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Azure, and preconfigured to meet healthcare requirements, this cloud solution enables organizations to efficiently coordinate care and engage consumers, reduce the cost of care, improve operational efficiency and impact the overall health of populations. The DXC Health360 suite includes the following modules to help accelerate healthcare digital transformation: DXC Health360 Engagement Center DXC Health360 Care Coordination DXC Health360 Consumer Engagement DXC Health360 Consumer Experience DXC Health360 Care Network Built on Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Azure, and preconfigured to meet healthcare requirements, DXC Health360 enables organizations in the following ways: Deliver coordinated care: Utilizing Health360, AiR Healthcare was able to scale its disease management program nationally, expand care plan coordination by increasing clinician case load by 650%, and help 80% of patients achieve substance use abstinence for 12 months compared to the national average of 35% substance use abstinence rate. Improve consumer engagement and reduce cost of care: Leveraging Health360 and integrating internet of things (IoT) devices to enable remote consumer monitoring and proactive telehealth support, Dartmouth-Hitchcock achieved a 36% reduction in total cost of care, 4 times the national health and wellness program engagement, 23% reduction in ER utilization and a 95% customer satisfaction rating. Reduce readmissions and deliver self-care: DXC implemented Health360 for Barnes Healthcare to remotely monitor, collect and analyze real-time consumer data, via mobile tablets, in order to help evaluate consumer readmission risk, and deliver self-care and other educational materials.

We are experienced in all types of loans, from the “prime of prime” to the “sub of sub-prime.” Financial organizations can latch onto a fixed set of functionalities and stay with it for a long time, simply due to reliability. As a result, the functionalities can become a set of “best practices.” Over time, pricing and processes can become rigid and static.

DXC Consumer Loan Processing delivers these outcomes: Reduced lending risk by improving policies, procedures, and content management Modern automation to drive compliance and consistency in business rules and increase data capture quality Improved speed to market by integrating systems, providing tools for faster decision-making, and building the ability to introduce new process more efficiently Enhanced customer service through digitization, validated by customer satisfaction metrics Turnkey, end-to-end solution — DXC can handle your entire loan servicing process, acquisition through liquidation, or assist with any part of the process.

While efficiency and expense reduction continue to challenge clients, new areas are becoming equally as important as the overall landscape is evolving. These challenges can be grouped into four areas to answer questions like: Mitigating compliance risk: How do we enhance our compliance program to be proactive and help support the overall culture and way we do business? Structuring operations to be agile and flexible: What areas can be updated to support a faster environment? Typical deal is a full BPO/BPS loan servicing opportunity. There is a one-time implementation fee. The fee includes any conversion from one system to the next.

With an aggregated self-service catalog for the customer's IT services and DXC-managed clouds (AWS, Azure, VMware/MSV), as well as customer managed private and/or public cloud and other service providers (i.e., network, storage, load balancers), HITS enables a client to become a broker of both customer and / or DXC managed hybrid services in a fully integrated solution. For higher level service offerings, such as a multi-tier application(s), HITS provides the ability to build catalog items that are provisioned across multiple cloud providers. Additionally, HITS provides automated governance of customer-defined corporate and regulatory policies to ensure compliance requirements can be met. The HITS solution is delivered as a DXC Managed Service with a consumption-based SaaS model (OPEX) and provides the additional benefit of visibility of spending across the services portfolio. For enterprises seeking to become a CSB to optimize their multi-cloud environment, DXC enables seamless integration between the customer's cloud consumption and ITSM processes on ServiceNow. Adopting a hybrid IT operating model to provide IT as a service can help enterprises mitigate ungoverned services consumption and control usage and costs of cloud services from multiple providers. The HITS managed service provides on-demand cloud services from a services catalog. The self-service user experience enables the client to order and manage subscriptions to cloud services from one place.

The release also features a modular consumption model that allows a client to start with the most urgent business disruptors, such as Critical Incident Management. This model aligns to the client's DXC Service Integration and Management maturity journey and provides a clear path to gaining control over their multi-supplier environment. Service Integration and Management (SIAM) is an essential component of the IT operating model for hybrid IT environments. Clients move to an IT operating model (ITOM) built to deliver faster, more reliable changes and higher efficiency. SIAM's transformational approach integrates, deploys, and manages services from multiple service providers. Our non-disruptive, multiphase approach uses industry standards including IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and a value-chain approach to the IT operating model (IT4IT). It also provides visibility, measures performance and deliverables, governs issue resolution and improves end-to-end performance. SIAM is available in multiple configurations aligned to client needs and includes advisory services and project expertise throughout the transformation process. As clients seek to adopt a more flexible, hybrid IT approach to succeed in the digital age, they are extending into cloud while retaining their traditional services. DXC SIAM helps clients control and manage the complexities of a hybrid environment that includes in-house IT, hardware vendors, and IT service providers. DXC SIAM provides a structured and integrated service delivery model that increases service delivery performance, implements industry best practices, and provides visibility across all service providers. It creates flexible IT service delivery with increased value and speed to the business. SIAM achieved the following results with a European banking customer: Create transformation roadmap – Facilitated the transformation to more mobile, digital technologies while managing a mix of hybrid cloud and traditional IT services and infrastructure Best of breed approach – Bank can now mix and match SaaS and other cloud-based applications based on their customer’s needs, with a best-of-breed approach to applications Drive service improvement – Managing end-to-end processes across their service providers and tracking overall performance and regulatory compliance. Automated and predictable – Offers a single-entry point for requesting a mix of IT services, ensuring these services are compliant and cost-effective, reducing manual IT tasks, increasing overall visibility, and streamlining approval and change management processes, resulting in automated and predictable provisioning. Expertise—Our experienced SIAM teams serve as the single point of escalation for the client's delivery issues, providing performance improvement and visibility across service providers, while managing and approving operational changes (adding or modifying infrastructure components or software across service providers). Transformation with minimal risk—Advisory and Transformation helps identify how to embark on the SIAM journey, while ensuring the maximum benefits with minimal risks. Scalability—We offer a range of options to meet the client's IT and financial objectives. We don't provide a “one-size-fits-all” approach because SIAM isn't simply categorized. DXC has helped our clients to gain the benefits of SIAM regardless of whether they wanted to build the capability on their own, co-source, or fully outsource to DXC. Adaptability across industries and geographies—Our SIAM service provides global reach and scale, suiting the client's demands across businesses, industries, regions and geographies—with in-country or in-region presence for regulatory drivers and compliance. Regulatory compliance—Our solutions are aligned to and even drive industry standards like ITIL and IT4IT, providing necessary safety according to client requirements. DXC has engaged with more than 30 of our top 200 enterprise accounts, managing an average of six primary outsourcing partners and 20+ secondary service providers. DXC delivers services to over 1,000 clients worldwide, including some of the world's largest enterprises and governments. DXC's IT Service Management (ITSM) expertise includes 4.4 million changes, incidents, and requests per month. DXC employs 12,000+ ITIL-certified professionals. Clients are spending time addressing operational topics, coordinating service providers, and fire-fighting rather than planning for business strategy and outcomes and continuous improvement programs.

          "page_body": "DXC Data Classification Services provides expert services to assist clients better understand existing system data and to protect and exploit their data on an ongoing basis. Data Classification Services enables a range of benefits, including reducing the risk of data loss or noncompliance to data legislation, optimizing data storage across information systems and enabling business users to maximize the benefits from data by improving accessibility and business processes. The Data Classification offering uses a comprehensive but flexible approach to create a program of activities that encompass all types of digital data across an organization, no matter what system the data are held on. This offering enables organizations to understand and control the data in their systems, to exploit the information and to control costs and risks associated with it. Data classification is the first step to take control before other governance activities are undertaken. As part of DXC’s Information Governance method, this offering provides a holistic approach to classification without tool vendor bias. Lower cost—As much as 30% of an organization’s unstructured information is redundant, outdated or trivial (ROT); up to 40% of data has indeterminate value. Data classification results enabled an organization to defensibly dispose of hundreds of terabytes of ROT from expensive local branch and central file shares. More value—Automatically identifying business records and assigning them to appropriate records categories helped an organization achieve better findability, faster collaboration, and enabled records to be treated according to business value. Lower risk—EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) non-compliance fines may be greater than €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue from the prior year. Several Data Classification Services clients are finding and mapping personal data under GDPR as a necessary first step to identify leakage and implement GDPR compliant business processes, avoiding huge potential fines. Proven experience—DXC information governance specialists have delivered classification projects for many real customers. Flexible delivery capability—DXC can resource projects with experienced people both onsite and from multiple delivery centers to best shape a project for individual customer’s needs. Vendor agnostic—DXC does not produce or sell our own software or tools and therefore can advise customers without bias. DXC does have partner relationships with leading vendors and is able to pass on preferential software discounts to clients. Comprehensive method—DXC’s service is based on a comprehensive approach to classification, developed to provide customers measurable results from their classification project. Affordable start to information governance—DXC’s holistic approach to information governance means that classification projects can be a quick start for a wider program, informing further activities if required.  900+ analytics clients worldwide  3,500+ information management and business intelligence professionals around the world  More than 100 dedicated data scientists in global delivery centers  18+ years of analytics experience with Fortune 500 clients worldwide Organizations are squeezed by rising data cost, tightening compliance demands and heightened public awareness of data breaches. Many companies have difficulty envisioning their information as a business asset as they struggle to manually categorize their data. The pressures underlying data management lead to hoarding behavior, which exacerbates the concerns involving data. Hoarding entails a compliance risk and exposes companies to increased litigation cost and data leakage risk. The increasing volumes also affect organizations’ ability to move to cloud storage solutions. As a result, organizations lack control over their data, are unable to derive valuable insights from it and are unable to mitigate compliance risk.

          "full_body": "Data Classification Services, Data Management, Data, Information Governance, data loss, data legislation, data storage Optimize data management by aligning it with the business value of information throughout the information lifecycle. DXC Data Classification Services provides expert services to assist clients better understand existing system data and to protect and exploit their data on an ongoing basis. Data Classification Services enables a range of benefits, including reducing the risk of data loss or noncompliance to data legislation, optimizing data storage across information systems and enabling business users to maximize the benefits from data by improving accessibility and business processes. The Data Classification offering uses a comprehensive but flexible approach to create a program of activities that encompass all types of digital data across an organization, no matter what system the data are held on. This offering enables organizations to understand and control the data in their systems, to exploit the information and to control costs and risks associated with it. Data classification is the first step to take control before other governance activities are undertaken. As part of DXC’s Information Governance method, this offering provides a holistic approach to classification without tool vendor bias. Lower cost—As much as 30% of an organization’s unstructured information is redundant, outdated or trivial (ROT); up to 40% of data has indeterminate value. Data classification results enabled an organization to defensibly dispose of hundreds of terabytes of ROT from expensive local branch and central file shares. More value—Automatically identifying business records and assigning them to appropriate records categories helped an organization achieve better findability, faster collaboration, and enabled records to be treated according to business value. Lower risk—EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) non-compliance fines may be greater than €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue from the prior year. Several Data Classification Services clients are finding and mapping personal data under GDPR as a necessary first step to identify leakage and implement GDPR compliant business processes, avoiding huge potential fines. Proven experience—DXC information governance specialists have delivered classification projects for many real customers. Flexible delivery capability—DXC can resource projects with experienced people both onsite and from multiple delivery centers to best shape a project for individual customer’s needs. Vendor agnostic—DXC does not produce or sell our own software or tools and therefore can advise customers without bias. DXC does have partner relationships with leading vendors and is able to pass on preferential software discounts to clients. Comprehensive method—DXC’s service is based on a comprehensive approach to classification, developed to provide customers measurable results from their classification project. Affordable start to information governance—DXC’s holistic approach to information governance means that classification projects can be a quick start for a wider program, informing further activities if required.  900+ analytics clients worldwide  3,500+ information management and business intelligence professionals around the world  More than 100 dedicated data scientists in global delivery centers  18+ years of analytics experience with Fortune 500 clients worldwide Organizations are squeezed by rising data cost, tightening compliance demands and heightened public awareness of data breaches. Many companies have difficulty envisioning their information as a business asset as they struggle to manually categorize their data. The pressures underlying data management lead to hoarding behavior, which exacerbates the concerns involving data. Hoarding entails a compliance risk and exposes companies to increased litigation cost and data leakage risk. The increasing volumes also affect organizations’ ability to move to cloud storage solutions. As a result, organizations lack control over their data, are unable to derive valuable insights from it and are unable to mitigate compliance risk.

Virtualized applications and desktops are accessible from a company's secure network or from the public Internet, allowing users flexible and secure work location and device options, including bring your own device (BYOD). The service bundles end-user assessment, solution design, implementation, and ongoing management for a monthly per-user price. VDA can decrease end-user support and management costs, while significantly increasing data security by moving it off endpoint devices into the datacenter. Support for iOS, Android, Macintosh and Windows endpoint devices provides users with device choices beyond the company PC and better datacenter-based application performance. The introduction of Windows 10, BYOD, and cloud services together pressure to reduce costs are driving enterprises to deliver workplace services differently. DXC Virtual Desktop and Applications Services help clients manage workplace complexities while  enabling them to meet business objectives, lower cost, increase the speed of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and improve data security. Lower cost—DXC helped a manufacturing company implement a digital workplace in which VDA was a major contributor to saving 50% of their previous budget annually.  Increase speed—VDA helped a healthcare corporation split from their parent company ahead of schedule effectively reducing their tax rate from 26% to 23%.  Improve data security—A European Bank became the financial industry's first \"PC-free\" bank in their effort to improve data security and improve secure access to key corporate applications. .  Flexible—DXC provides flexible service configurations, infrastructure, and delivery locations. We can run virtualization solutions in traditional data center at your location or ours, a Private cloud or Microsoft Azure. In addition, we provide  delivery resources from five VDA Centers of Excellence around the world.  Experienced—DXC has been designing, implementing, and operating VDA and the servers they run on for over 18 years. Our experience is both deep (complex environments) and wide (global, multi-site implementations). With over 1 Million supported  users and 110,000 supported virtual applications, we are a Gartner-recognized global leader.  Increased speed to value—Repeatable transformation processes and a service deployment methodology that use empirical data to size the virtualization infrastructure and optimize deployment strategies eliminates the guesswork that can destabilize  the rollout period.  Partnerships—Longstanding, close partnerships with industry leaders—like Microsoft, Citrix, and VMware—enable us to develop, build, configure, and tune server platforms to perform VDA. Our strong partnerships provide an excellent  platform for delivering high-quality VDA.  Comprehensive—DXC is committed to an integrated view of your workplace, with VDA being an important element in a comprehensive workplace strategy.

DXC's managed services provide a dedicated flexible client portal with optional backup and virus protection services. The client buys configurable services through an OpEx model and can scale up and down as needed—in a matter of minutes or hours—to meet dynamic business needs. DXC provides clients with managed private cloud services that leverage the flexibility and scale of public cloud services. Clients are under pressure to migrate workloads to the cloud to relieve CapEx pressures and leverage the flexibility of cloud infrastructure. One of the greatest challenges is the time and expense required to transform applications to run in that environment. DXC Managed Services for VMware Cloud on AWS wraps an integrated set of services and automation around the client's VMware Cloud that eases migration, increases flexibility and reduces capital expenses. Ease migration—A major university migrated hundreds of virtual servers to VMware Cloud in less than 96 hours without re-architecting workloads, resulting in minimal impact to research efforts.

Coding Network deals in SFDC Opportunities that are led by either Workplace and Mobility or Cloud and Platform Services should code entries in Salesforce.com such that they reflect the revenue recognition to the respective offerings. For example, if a Workplace and Mobility-led pursuit solutions a Campus LAN/WLAN and WAN opportunity, code that pursuit under Campus and Connectivity Networks. Likewise if a Cloud and Platform Services-led pursuit solutions a Data Center LAN and WAN to the Client's network, code that pursuit under Network Services. DXC Managed Software-Defined Network Services provide lower cost and more agile virtualized network capabilities across the enterprise — from data centers to campus networks. DXC addresses three key enterprise networks: WAN – the backbone of the enterprise, connecting all sites The Edge – the boundary between the enterprise WAN and campus LANs Data Center – the networks at the heart of the enterprise device and the connections to productivity applications in public, private and hybrid cloud environments. DXC can help clients achieve the cost and service delivery benefits of modernizing while maximizing the life span of legacy infrastructure. DXC ensures that clients can maintain the highest security standards and fulfill all regulatory requirements. We understand that business outcomes matter, and having a solid, well-managed network infrastructure is key to your success. Whether the client is transforming to next-generation infrastructure or adding new functionality to the IT estate, DXC can help enterprises make a seamless digital transformation through these Managed SDN Services: WAN services WANs are the links that tie enterprises to their remote locations, clients, cloud service providers and data centers. WANs must provide secure services driven by SLAs while providing more agile, cost-effective connectivity. DXC offers two software-defined WAN solutions targeted at different connectivity issues: cloud connectivity and WAN costs AT&T NetBond for Cloud is an option added to an AT&T MPLS circuit that provides connectivity to more than 20 different cloud service providers, including AWS and Azure. With NetBond, the cloud service providers appear as nodes on your existing MPLS network. NetBond greatly simplifies the process of connecting while providing the security and reliability of MPLS. NetBond is available globally and provides simple, secure, cost-effective support for hybrid cloud environments. DXC Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN), powered by AT&T, applies software-defined networking concepts to WAN connections. Our SD-WAN solution automatically determines the most effective way to route traffic to and from campus and data center sites. DXC SD-WAN service lowers operational and capital costs, ensuring lower total cost of ownership, greater business agility and responsiveness to keep pace with IT innovations. The Edge The boundary between the enterprise WAN and campus LANs must ensure high reliability and security. DXC and AT&T are working together to provide next-generation technology to the edge, including: AT&T FlexWare, which combines SDN and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies to simplify network infrastructure while potentially lowering capital investments. By deploying software-based virtual appliances instead of hardware, organizations can reduce time, labor and costs associated with buying, installing, configuring and maintaining separate physical and proprietary network equipment. Data center DXC Software-Defined Data Center LAN (SD-DC LAN) service enables organizations to expand their networks without being locked into vendors. Our SD-DC LAN, based on VMware’s NSX and Arista switching technology, helps improve agility and security in today’s hybrid computing environments. DXC and AT&T have deep experience and an integrated delivery model.

Selling DXC Managed Software Defined Network Services Use this selling content to position the full range of DXC Network Services, powered by AT&T. Visit the for materials that focus on connectivity for end-users. Reference the sub-offerings listed below for additional material detailing data center network services. Coding Network deals in SFDC Opportunities that are led by either Workplace and Mobility or Cloud and Platform Services should code entries in Salesforce.com such that they reflect the revenue recognition to the respective offerings. For example, if a Workplace and Mobility-led pursuit solutions a Campus LAN/WLAN and WAN opportunity, code that pursuit under Campus and Connectivity Networks. Likewise if a Cloud and Platform Services-led pursuit solutions a Data Center LAN and WAN to the Client's network, code that pursuit under Network Services. DXC Managed Software-Defined Network Services provide lower cost and more agile virtualized network capabilities across the enterprise — from data centers to campus networks. DXC addresses three key enterprise networks: WAN – the backbone of the enterprise, connecting all sites The Edge – the boundary between the enterprise WAN and campus LANs Data Center – the networks at the heart of the enterprise device and the connections to productivity applications in public, private and hybrid cloud environments. DXC can help clients achieve the cost and service delivery benefits of modernizing while maximizing the life span of legacy infrastructure. DXC ensures that clients can maintain the highest security standards and fulfill all regulatory requirements. We understand that business outcomes matter, and having a solid, well-managed network infrastructure is key to your success. Whether the client is transforming to next-generation infrastructure or adding new functionality to the IT estate, DXC can help enterprises make a seamless digital transformation through these Managed SDN Services: WAN services WANs are the links that tie enterprises to their remote locations, clients, cloud service providers and data centers. WANs must provide secure services driven by SLAs while providing more agile, cost-effective connectivity. DXC offers two software-defined WAN solutions targeted at different connectivity issues: cloud connectivity and WAN costs AT&T NetBond for Cloud is an option added to an AT&T MPLS circuit that provides connectivity to more than 20 different cloud service providers, including AWS and Azure. With NetBond, the cloud service providers appear as nodes on your existing MPLS network. NetBond greatly simplifies the process of connecting while providing the security and reliability of MPLS. NetBond is available globally and provides simple, secure, cost-effective support for hybrid cloud environments. DXC Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN), powered by AT&T, applies software-defined networking concepts to WAN connections. Our SD-WAN solution automatically determines the most effective way to route traffic to and from campus and data center sites. DXC SD-WAN service lowers operational and capital costs, ensuring lower total cost of ownership, greater business agility and responsiveness to keep pace with IT innovations. The Edge The boundary between the enterprise WAN and campus LANs must ensure high reliability and security. DXC and AT&T are working together to provide next-generation technology to the edge, including: AT&T FlexWare, which combines SDN and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies to simplify network infrastructure while potentially lowering capital investments. By deploying software-based virtual appliances instead of hardware, organizations can reduce time, labor and costs associated with buying, installing, configuring and maintaining separate physical and proprietary network equipment. Data center DXC Software-Defined Data Center LAN (SD-DC LAN) service enables organizations to expand their networks without being locked into vendors. Our SD-DC LAN, based on VMware’s NSX and Arista switching technology, helps improve agility and security in today’s hybrid computing environments.

The client realized a 33% reduction in effort to process orders and a 40% reduction in administration requirements. Reduced cost—DXC worked with a large financial institution to consolidate real estate and redefine the physical workspace of the future. Significant cost savings were reinvested into the workspace program to make it effectively self-funding.

Our technical and industry knowledge allows us to create business solutions that integrate legacy environments into the modern enterprise.

Clients seek to introduce more effective ways to meet virtually, cutting travel and telecommunication costs and eliminating wasted time traveling (cheaper). No matter the driver, clients do not always have the resources and skills to implement successful digital transformation. They need to engage third parties to consult and implement the desired change. Open Doors to the C-Suite—Consulting engagements change the conversation to more of a top-down, C-suite conversation about the clients’ digital innovation agenda in areas of the business where bigger budgets reside. High-margin, Revenue-intensive (ABR)—Consulting deals are high margin (> 40%), revenue-intensive deals that generate strong in-year revenue. Significant Pull-through Opportunities—Small Workplace consulting engagements around Office 365 can lead to significant pull-through of large-scale workplace transformation and managed services opportunities.

DXC Managed Connectivity Services help our clients see the cost and service delivery benefits of moving to next-generation network solutions, while maximizing the life span of legacy infrastructure. We ensure clients maintain the highest security standards and fulfill growing regulatory requirements through three connectivity offers: Global Connectivity provides a standard, secure, SLA-driven, competitively priced solution to clients in all regions. Leveraged Connectivity enables clients to take advantage of DXC's market presence to buy bandwidth when needed, while maintaining the security and quality they expect. Third-Party Connectivity allows clients to use the transport providers they prefer while keeping DXC responsible for overall network solution integration. Global Connectivity Through our strategic partnership with AT&T, DXC provides a globally consistent set of connectivity solutions: DXC VPN, Powered by AT&T is an MPLS Service that creates a highly secure network connecting multiple locations and users.

DXC supports several third-party solutions that address these requirements, allowing DXC to maintain overall solution responsibility.

Our services enable clients to improve and streamline information processes so that clients can remain compliant with organizational and regulatory mandates. C&RMS can also improve business efficiency and productivity, information security, and operational cost savings significantly by managing both business documents and records proactively throughout their lifecycle from the point of creation. DXC offers flexible delivery options (on premises, as a service, or hybrid) and commercial models to minimize investment risk. This offering enables clients to transform information into vital resources—into dollars saved or costs avoided. These benefits result when clients capture, manage, secure, and discover business assets to meet governance and regulatory compliance. Better productivity and efficiency—Individuals can spend an average of four weeks a year searching for misfiled, mislabeled, untracked, or “lost” information, spending about 26% of their efforts looking, while finding what is needed only 56% of the time.1 Through workflow and policy-enabled processes, C&RMS has cut approval times by 60% (from days to hours to minutes), depending on the use case. Lower risk—Penalties for non-compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act could be as high as $725,000 for each act meeting specific criteria. C&RMS enables better control over information to guard against data leaks, ensure greater regulatory compliance, and prevent data spoliation and any resulting sanctions, fines, and lawsuits. Lower cost—As much as 30% of an organization’s unstructured information is redundant, outdated, or trivial (ROT); up to 50% of data has an indeterminate value.2 A better approach is to identify and maintain the truly important data and to dispose of the rest, yielding a smaller storage footprint, a lower IT and administration spend, more effective legal holds, and more cost-effective e-Discovery. Some legal experts maintain that RM and e-Discovery efficiencies can be in the range of 40%. 1The Knowledge Quotient: Unlocking the Hidden Value of Information Using Search and Content Analytics, 2014. 2Gartner.

          "full_body": "records management, information governance, content management, compliant, regulatory, capture, lifetime management, security, access, client information, records management as a service Proactively capture, secure, and manage your business information—regardless of the system or source As a cornerstone of the DXC Information Governance portfolio, Content and Records Management Services (C&RMS) facilitate the secure access, collaboration, and management of enterprise information in the context of business processes and transactions. Our services enable clients to improve and streamline information processes so that clients can remain compliant with organizational and regulatory mandates. C&RMS can also improve business efficiency and productivity, information security, and operational cost savings significantly by managing both business documents and records proactively throughout their lifecycle from the point of creation. DXC offers flexible delivery options (on premises, as a service, or hybrid) and commercial models to minimize investment risk. This offering enables clients to transform information into vital resources—into dollars saved or costs avoided. These benefits result when clients capture, manage, secure, and discover business assets to meet governance and regulatory compliance. Better productivity and efficiency—Individuals can spend an average of four weeks a year searching for misfiled, mislabeled, untracked, or “lost” information, spending about 26% of their efforts looking, while finding what is needed only 56% of the time.1 Through workflow and policy-enabled processes, C&RMS has cut approval times by 60% (from days to hours to minutes), depending on the use case. Lower risk—Penalties for non-compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act could be as high as $725,000 for each act meeting specific criteria. C&RMS enables better control over information to guard against data leaks, ensure greater regulatory compliance, and prevent data spoliation and any resulting sanctions, fines, and lawsuits. Lower cost—As much as 30% of an organization’s unstructured information is redundant, outdated, or trivial (ROT); up to 50% of data has an indeterminate value.2 A better approach is to identify and maintain the truly important data and to dispose of the rest, yielding a smaller storage footprint, a lower IT and administration spend, more effective legal holds, and more cost-effective e-Discovery. Some legal experts maintain that RM and e-Discovery efficiencies can be in the range of 40%. 1The Knowledge Quotient: Unlocking the Hidden Value of Information Using Search and Content Analytics, 2014. 2Gartner.

DXC manages the purchase and provision of storage software and hardware, and hosts it in a client or DXC data center, in a shared or dedicated environment. Clients consume next-generation storage on a gigabyte basis, and can allocate data in different performance/availability tiers depending on its usage or value. We can support 10TB infrastructures and more. Fine-tune storage requirements through six classes of service for block data like databases, three classes of service for file data, and an ultra-high performance all-Flash option. Unlike procuring storage infrastructure through a traditional capital expense model where clients buy storage capacity in large segments, DXC Storage as a Service allows clients to move from a CapEx to OpEx procurement model. Clients pay only for the storage they use after data reduction freeing up capital to support other business needs. Clients also gain complete visibility into storage performance and costs, increase business agility with our capacity buffer, and can reduce overall storage costs by 30 percent. Increase business agility—A global technology company saved 30% on its storage costs using an as-a-service model. They can now meet future storage needs in a convenient and highly-agile manner through the utility construct and provided buffer capacity. Reduce costs—A global security and defense products company reduced IT spend on unstructured storage by 52% over a 5-year period with storage as a service. Right-size performance—The naval equipment division of a global defense products company implemented storage as a service to save 50% on storage costs by moving infrequently accessed data to cost-effective object storage service. DXC’s storage service uses policies to move data to low-cost object storage based on the client’s access patterns of the data. Cost optimization—Unlike competitors who model increases in storage costs over time, DXC helps clients optimize and even reduce storage costs. Our approach informs the client about capacity and performance, and we make it easy for them to see where they might be paying for performance they are not using. Expertise—DXC manages 750 petabytes of storage for clients, and has over 50 years’ experience in managing compute and data environments for commercial and public sector organizations across the globe. DXC leverages this expertise and our partner network to build the right solution for any workload. Flexibility—Quickly scale storage needs up/down based on business demand through a simple service catalog and a 10% capacity buffer. Vertical industry experience—DXC is one of few providers that can fully understand a client’s industry and the implications to their digital transformation, storage environment and cloud, hybrid and compute models. Security—DXC provides end-to-end security expertise to protect client data, offering three levels of data protection from replication to full disaster recovery. We can deliver Storage as a Service in the most highly secure environments. DXC manages over 750 petabytes of storage and 250 petabytes of backup for clients Best-of-breed hardware and software partners create a robust, enterprise-class service ISO 27001 certified data centers, with ISO 9001 and ITIL-compliant processes Global support for the utility model available in 29 countries with on- shore and offshore delivery models Traditional data storage environments are capital intensive, lack automated, comprehensive reporting and visibility, and cannot scale as quickly as a client’s business changes. Capital purchasing cycles take too long to respond to peaks in demand. When storage demand decreases, clients pay for excess capacity that sits unused. Cloud and hybrid computing models need equally adaptive storage and recovery models, which is why many companies are adopting an as-a-service model for their storage environments. Further, many industries are experiencing merger and acquisition activities, and need to consolidate overlapping and aging infrastructures. Increases in government and industry regulation place an even greater responsibility on organizations to ensure compliance to these directives. Deal size—3-year term, deal TCV ranges $1M – $3M with a low base starting point that grows higher in out years. Cross-sell opportunities include Backup as a Service, Continuity Services, and any of our Cloud offerings Pricing—Per written consumed gigabyte for the base service and the optional services of replication, snapshots, and disk encryption Transition/Transformation—It typically takes seven weeks from contract signing to stand up the service Target clients—Clients in any region/industry seeking to scale storage without capital investment    CLIENT  REGION  INDUSTRY  CLOSED/WON     United Technologies Corp  Americas  Manufacturing  Oct 2017    DSB  N.C.

Vertical industry experience—DXC is one of few providers that can fully understand a client’s industry and the implications to their digital transformation, storage environment and cloud, hybrid and compute models. Security—DXC provides end-to-end security expertise to protect client data, offering three levels of data protection from replication to full disaster recovery. We can deliver Storage as a Service in the most highly secure environments. DXC manages over 750 petabytes of storage and 250 petabytes of backup for clients Best-of-breed hardware and software partners create a robust, enterprise-class service ISO 27001 certified data centers, with ISO 9001 and ITIL-compliant processes Global support for the utility model available in 29 countries with on- shore and offshore delivery models Traditional data storage environments are capital intensive, lack automated, comprehensive reporting and visibility, and cannot scale as quickly as a client’s business changes. Capital purchasing cycles take too long to respond to peaks in demand. When storage demand decreases, clients pay for excess capacity that sits unused. Cloud and hybrid computing models need equally adaptive storage and recovery models, which is why many companies are adopting an as-a-service model for their storage environments. Further, many industries are experiencing merger and acquisition activities, and need to consolidate overlapping and aging infrastructures. Increases in government and industry regulation place an even greater responsibility on organizations to ensure compliance to these directives. Deal size—3-year term, deal TCV ranges $1M – $3M with a low base starting point that grows higher in out years. Cross-sell opportunities include Backup as a Service, Continuity Services, and any of our Cloud offerings Pricing—Per written consumed gigabyte for the base service and the optional services of replication, snapshots, and disk encryption Transition/Transformation—It typically takes seven weeks from contract signing to stand up the service Target clients—Clients in any region/industry seeking to scale storage without capital investment    CLIENT  REGION  INDUSTRY  CLOSED/WON     United Technologies Corp  Americas  Manufacturing  Oct 2017    DSB  N.C.

Learn more from the video. Regardless of size, industry or analytics maturity, organizations struggle to get all the necessary data in one place, consistently organized and classified for the spend and procurement analytics they need. DXC Spend Analytics has a flexible approach, offering end-to-end spend data transformation and visualizations as-a-service or leveraging our 15 years of experience with over 1,000 public and private sector clients to quickly deliver custom projects or enhance a client's existing solution. For clients anywhere on the procurement maturity spectrum, DXC can deliver the procurement management information needed to gain better control of spending, save money, reduce risk and improve efficiency in procurement processes and practices. DXC Spend Analytics provides clients accurate data and deep insights to get more value out of every dollar their organization spends on goods and services, make procurement processes more efficient, engage with their business effectively, reduce supply chain risk, deliver procurement sustainability and diversity goals, and increase procurement compliance. Best possible data—From a Fortune 500 company operating as 12 separate business units with 12 enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in four countries to a small public sector organization with a very old AP system, DXC leverages a 500M item and 16M supplier reference database, data scientists, external data sources, machine learning, traditional BI techniques, and a private crowd of research analysts to routinely reach over 97% classification rates, match in data from third party sources and deliver clients the most accurate and reliable procurement data possible. Quick time to value— DXC assembles prebuilt, scalable data transformation and visualization components, where possible, to deliver clients transformed procurement data and visualizations in as few as 2 weeks. One manufacturing client got its first insights in 10 business days, enabling it to identify millions in indirect cost savings 6 months earlier than they anticipated. Minimal client resources required—DXC leverages the experience of working with over 1,000 clients to minimize the time and resources our clients put in to get a spend and procurement analytics deliverable focused on their strategic objectives and priorities. One client was spending two weeks extracting and manipulating their data prior to providing it to their previous spend analytics supplier; DXC reduced that to 16 hours for the first extraction and 2 hours for each subsequent update. Deep domain expertise—DXC puts to work the expertise gained from over 15 years as trusted advisors to senior procurement and finance professionals in the delivery of procurement analytics solutions to over 1,000 organizations. Flexibility to choose components—DXC’s analytics expertise, technology partnerships and experience in custom and industry standard categorization taxonomies create flexibility to choose the best components to meet the client's requirements and deliver insights well beyond those from rigidly fixed spend analysis tools or those linked directly to a transactional system. Focus on outcomes—Component flexibility allows DXC to focus on clients’ objectives and priorities, delivering analytics that provide answers to the key business questions rather than forcing the client’s needs to fit a preconfigured solution. Focus on data—DXC utilizes classification taxonomies that are appropriate for the type of data, industry sector and analytical output required, combining traditional BI and AI tools and methods, supported by human validation throughout the process to deliver analytics relevant to our clients’ needs and available data. Results for all maturity levels—DXC has delivered procurement analytics for clients of all sizes and at both ends of the procurement analytics maturity spectrum. Whether the client is just starting out or has already invested in in-house analytics skills and technologies, DXC can help them deliver the next level of insights. Fifteen years’ experience, 1,000+ clients, 4,000+ datasets and $750B+ of spend transformed Delivered spend visibility to organizations with 1, 2, 5, 12, 15, 24 and 100+ business units and unique data sources Most customers stay more than 5 years Companies struggle to get accurate, actionable, holistic visibility of procurement and spend data.

Spend data often includes duplicate  suppliers, inconsistent/incorrect classifications, and is missing third party data points about suppliers critical to a modern procurement function.

          "page_body": "DXC Backup as a Service provides a cost-effective managed service for backup and recovery of all types of data. The client chooses whether the data is hosted in their data centers and remote offices, DXC datacenters, or public cloud environments. DXC then manages the purchase, configuration, protection and management of the backup data aligned to the business impact of the data. Service options include high-perfomance backup and rapid recovery for critical workloads. We leverage data deduplication technology to optimize performance and cost and to segregate extended retention data to object store for further cost reduction. Regardless of the type or location of a company's data assets, Backup as a Service protects and recovers data where clients need it while observing national data sovereignty rules with locally deployed assets and in-country support. Clients may choose offshore support options for data not impacted by data sovereignty rules. Traditional data backup methods rely on magnetic tape, racking up costs for both the recording equipment and the tape storage and retention. DXC Backup as a Service eliminates the need for tape backup and provides a centralized, scalable solution for critical and non-critical data. Clients can save 30% on the total cost of data backup, transition costs from a CapEx to an OpEx model, and keep data safe using the latest data protection technologies. Reduce costs—A North American shipbuilder was able to achieve 25% savings over a five-year period for their backup environment while reducing their capital expenditure by $3M. The client reinvested the capital elsewhere in the business. Improve recovery times—A global educational testing company was able to improve the backup and recovery of their largest database environment. Backup as a Service reduced backup and recovery times by 95%, which helped the client address their daily issue of overrunning their backup windows. Protect backup data—A global technology and aerospace company eliminated tape media from hundreds of remote sites and migrated backup to regional replication data centers, which improved the reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness of data protection. Cost optimization—Unlike competitors who model increases in backup costs over time, DXC helps clients optimize and even reduce backup costs. Our approach provides backup mobility between physical hosts, private virtual clouds, and public cloud environments for all types of data and applications. Expertise—DXC manages 250 petabytes of backup for clients and has over 50 years of experience in managing compute and data environments for commercial and public-sector organizations across the globe. DXC leverages this expertise and our partner network to build the right solution for any workload. Flexibility—Clients can quickly scale backup needs up and down based on business demand through a simple service catalog and a 10 percent capacity buffer. Clients can also choose to start small and grow their backup at a pace that suits their business. Security—DXC provides end-to-end security expertise to protect data, offering three levels of data protection from replication to full disaster recovery. We can deliver Backup as a Service in the most highly secure environments. Vertical industry experience—DXC is one of few providers that can fully understand a client's industry and the implications to their digital transformation, storage environment and cloud, hybrid and compute models. Demand for data backup and protection is only growing, and so are the costs to maintain these backups. Clients have to continually increase the volume of data backups to respond to business requirements. Additionally, data centers are notorious for consuming power and space, causing IT to reach limitations ahead of plan. And in-house operations staff continuously need to keep pace with accelerating technology innovation. Backups, and more importantly restores, must be readily available, highly secure, and within budget. Given the advancements in cloud and hybrid computing, it's time to replace capital budget backup operations, asset management, tools, and facilities with a secure, flexible pay-per-use option from a trusted partner. Deal Size: Three-year term, deal TCV ranges $1M – $3M with a low base starting point that grows higher in out years. Cross-sell opportunities include Storage as a Service, Continuity Services and any of our Cloud offerings. Pricing: Per written or consumed gigabyte for the base service and the optional services of replication, public cloud hosting, and disk encryption. Transition/Transformation: It typically takes seven weeks from contract signing to stand up the service. Target clients: Clients in any region/industry seeking to scale backup requirements without capital investment.   CLIENT  REGION  INDUSTRY  CLOSED/WON    Voestalpine group-IT GmbH  N.C.

DXC Backup as a Service provides a cost-effective managed service for backup and recovery of all types of data. The client chooses whether the data is hosted in their data centers and remote offices, DXC datacenters, or public cloud environments. DXC then manages the purchase, configuration, protection and management of the backup data aligned to the business impact of the data. Service options include high-perfomance backup and rapid recovery for critical workloads. We leverage data deduplication technology to optimize performance and cost and to segregate extended retention data to object store for further cost reduction. Regardless of the type or location of a company's data assets, Backup as a Service protects and recovers data where clients need it while observing national data sovereignty rules with locally deployed assets and in-country support.

Digital lifestyles are driving new behaviors and more onerous expectations about experience – for example, a utility’s experience will be compared with that of a high-tech company. Therefore, businesses must adapt to an unprecedented pace of change – early movers and fast new entrants from adjacent industries are leveraging digital to disrupt every industry. Clients do not always have the expertise to lead these massive transformation  efforts, and are torn between running the business and transforming the business.

Our experts meet client business and IT needs through transforming and implementing some of the world’s largest and most complex businesses including people, processes, and tools. Optimized recovery times—A manufacturer of water heating systems implemented a cost‑effective disaster recovery (DR) solution to protect its IT-enabled business processes and significantly improve DR metrics; Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 7.5 hours, previously 5 days, and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 15 minutes, previously 24 hours, while requiring only one DR rehearsal per year. Audit compliance and risk management—Compliance with stricter banking rules enabled one client to ensure near zero failure rate, improved access to data and always-on disaster protection. High availability Continuity Advisory Services guaranteed disaster recovery with no negative impact. Effective cost-saving recovery—A U.S. public sector agency reduced its IT costs by 20%, improved system availability and reliability with zero severity 1 or 2 outages, and ensured system redundancy with near-100% network uptime.

DXC's solutions provide global support with the capability to integrate across cloud, traditional IT and hybrid environments. Low risk—For client recovery center services contracts there are strict limits on the number of clients assigned to the same leveraged asset.
