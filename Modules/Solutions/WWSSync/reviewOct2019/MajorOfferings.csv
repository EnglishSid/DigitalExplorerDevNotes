It comprises of a suite of standard components for an integrated set of technology platforms and services that enable digital solutions with runtime and operational efficiencies.","On this page: Value Proposition Why DXC? Proof Points Target Clients Business Challenges Deal Characteristics Client Wins Next Steps SFDC Information  Digital foundation is a framework that is cross practice, cross industry, and cross offering family. It comprises of a suite of standard components for an integrated set of technology platforms and services that enable digital solutions with runtime and operational efficiencies. It covers the integrated process, application, data, operational, development, and productivity platforms typically provided by IT shared services (i.e. CIO) in secure hybrid / multi-cloud configurations. The digital foundation framework allows DXC to show how we can accelerate the modernization of core capabilities in a digital operating environment including data integration, systems re-engineering, and legacy consolidation to form a new IT operating model. Digital foundation is the layer where the new LOB business models get connected, and the enterprise architecture enables efficient platform strategies. Value Proposition DXC Technology enables safe, successful modernization at scale by deploying and tailoring a secure digital foundation that integrates the technology platforms which enable business change at the speed and pace the firm requires. We start by delivering ~25% reduction in run rate expenses using our Bionix intelligent automation and Platform DXC operational platform capabilities, freeing up funding for further innovation and change programs. Then we modernize our clients' IT by adapting even the most mission-critical applications to harness cloud and digital technologies while integrating, securing, and operating their hybrid / multi-cloud environments at scale. By designing, deploying and securing our clients' digital foundation, DXC enables a new IT operating model, and provides a way forward to solving complex modernization and transformation challenges at scale. Why DXC? The competence to deliver complex projects on a global scale—DXC as a systems integrator is differentiated from strategy and consulting firms by our ability to build and scale solutions globally across the client's enterprise. We have the ability to build new digital platforms and integrate these solutions into the client's current estate, and in many cases, we know and manage their current estate. Our solutioning approach with our partners—Because we are technology-independent, we can leverage the R&D investment of a broad ecosystem of partners. Our deep relationships with partners allow us to provide innovative technology platforms to build the precise digital foundation our clients need while minimizing their risks. The commercial value we bring, enabled by new engagement and operating models—We offer modern commercial terms and will wrap all of our operating and commercial models around the client's old and new environments and incentivize movement from old to new over time and drive optimization to unlock the ability to implement the future platforms clients need. Our significant investment in service management and delivery across digital and mainstream—DXC Bionix™ is our data-driven approach to intelligent automation, and Platform DXC™, our managed development and operational services engine. This is the DXC path to digital, and it is a way to coexist with existing systems. It is the way that DXC has tackled its own digital transformation as it has built out its own digital foundation.

DXC managed the overall project and the multiple parties involved. DXC Red Rock provisioned the technical elements of the new Exadata X7 infrastructure deployment, configuration and operational readiness.","  Powering the world of financial services Client: Financial services company Location: Melbourne, Australia Industry: Banking & Financial Services Case Study: Financial Services This financial institution is on a journey to create a new world of financial services, challenging the status quo and looking for ways to be better; for its customers, partners and employees. A prominent financial services provider in Australia and New Zealand, the company’s major product line is consumer finance. The organisation offers personal loans, credit cards, car loans, and personal insurance; and partners with some of the region’s most iconic and successful retailers driving retail finance business. Challenge With an existing Oracle Exadata Database Machine and related services nearing end of life and approaching maximum performance capacity, the organisation required a solution to meet their future needs. Exadata runs all the company’s business critical database workloads including online transaction processing, data warehousing, and in-memory analytics which feed into credit collection solutions. This allows the financial services provider to service its consumers efficiently across the entire originations process, from new customer product origination to approval/ funds disbursal. Barely coping with current workloads, the company’s existing Exadata system (X2- 2) was five versions behind the current version (X7-2) and could not accommodate future growth. In addition, the organisation had planned a production data centre move, presenting the ideal opportunity to start fresh. The relocating and upgrading of an outdated platform also presented a high risk of outage to critical systems. The company required a tight cutover and minimal outage to ensure availability for key business as usual (BAU) operations. Solution Since DXC already supported the company’s full infrastructure stack, the team had first hand insight into the client’s business requirements. DXC proactively undertook careful evaluation of platform options in order to determine the best fit-for-purpose solution. Victor Lal, DXC’s Account General Manager said, “The planning process was highly iterative and collaborative. We worked very closely with the client to weigh up the options to produce the best outcome for their business.” The solution involved several vendors who were involved in the implementation. Managed overall by DXC, all parties worked in sync to run multiple activities in parallel. DXC’s Red Rock team were responsible for negotiating the Oracle commercials and provisioned the technical elements of the new Exadata X7 infrastructure deployment, configuration and operational readiness. With over eight years’ experience delivering Exadata solutions and services across all major models and deployment sizes, DXC Red Rock, DXC Technology’s Oracle practice in Australia and New Zealand is the largest independent provider of Oracle consulting and managed services in the region. As a result of DXC’s expertise, the client felt supported throughout the entire project. The program manager for the financial services provider said: “DXC were able to bring together all parties to migrate our critical business systems with no impact to BAU. The execution was flawless from procurement through to delivery.” Challenge • Existing Oracle Exadata platform nearing end of life (and five generations behind latest version) • Impending data centre move meant high risk in relocating old technology • Requirement for a solution to accommodate future growth Solution • Comprehensive build, upgrade and migration of old Exadata X2-2 environment to new Exadata X7-2 environment • Three separate project phases involving several teams and vendors working in sync to run multiple activities in parallel • DXC engaged to manage overall project and multiple parties involved Results • Improved performance, cost- effectiveness and availability of Oracle databases • Significantly improved batch run times allows a greater window to perform essential credit collection and other business critical functions • The ability to process more orders in less time with lower latency, faster identification and response to customer trends 2 Case Study: Financial Services Implementation The Exadata upgrade project was a large and extremely complex new infrastructure deployment with mission critical workloads, over 20 database upgrades, and 12 separate IT change events required to go live. DXC led the design, build, upgrade and deployment/migration of the new environment with unique technical excellence and high-quality deliverables, even with the rigid milestone deadlines (due to impending data centre move) in just three months. The project included the removal of end of life hardware at the existing data centre and the implementation of new state-of-the art technology, while also leveraging the opportunity to install new infrastructure into the brand new data centre. This eliminated the potential risk involved in relocating old technology from the second existing data centre which was decommissioned. The entire program was split into three phases – each then split into production and non-production environments across the two separate centres: • Phase 1: New Exadata X7-2 installation • Phase 2: In place database upgrades • Phase 3: Database migrations Just one week prior to scheduled go live, the existing Exadata system starting failing and immediate implementation ahead of schedule was requested - which the DXC team was able to accommodate. Keys to success Activities successfully ran in parallel as a result of the seamless collaboration between all parties. DXC ran a master schedule with strong collaboration amongst multiple sales, solution design, delivery and operational support teams; as well as key project engagement partners, Oracle, AT&T, and the backup and data centre facilities/onsite teams. DXC Catalyst project management methodologies were proactively applied; the OEDA (Oracle Exadata Deployment Assistant) tool was used to capture and create the configuration for new Exadata X7 systems commissioning; and the Oracle data guard migration approach ensured a flawless workload migration cutover with no business impact for the client. Delivery of timely technical workshops ensured complex technical solutions were planned well ahead of time with smooth subsequent delivery. Detailed cutover plans were developed, with every single risk considered prior to execution. Backup, and DBA teams worked together throughout the delivery lifecycle to quickly and efficiently resolve any technical issues. This level of planning and oversight was essential since the company’s hard deadline meant any delays had potential to impact the impending data centre migration and move. 3 Case Study: Financial Services Results Given the timebound new data centre migration involved an extremely tight implementation timeframe with mission critical workloads, the client was understandably nervous. While initially sceptical the tight deadlines could be met, DXC exceeded all expectations with a well-executed project delivery effort. The project was implemented with seamless cutover from old to new with DXC’s program delivery execution rated a perfect 10 out of 10 and applauded by the client’s executive team. The new solution is engineered to deliver dramatically better performance, cost effectiveness, and availability for Oracle databases. It provides the financial services provider with increased performance and significantly improved batch run times (reduced by an average of two hours) with a greater window for the company to perform mission critical functions. The financial services provider now has the ability to process more transactions in less time with lower latency, real-time visibility into systems, and faster identification and response to customer trends. According to the program manager, “the new Exadata environment is absolutely flying, it is reliable and has the capacity for additional workloads to support the company’s business needs well into the future.” Next steps Technology is being used as an enabler for the client to achieve its goals and challenge the status quo in the traditional financial services sector. DXC now provides ongoing support services to the organisation and is currently analysing other Oracle systems to ensure optimal performance.

DG_2302a-20. October 2019 Case Study: Financial Services http://www.dxc.technology/ https://thrive.dxc.technology/ ",0,Powering the world of financial services: Client Case Study,0,"Australia, Exadata X7, PARTNERS, Oracle, Oakton, AT&T, Red Rock, DXC Red Rock, Latitude Financial Services, infrastructure deployment, mission critical, database upgrades, migration of Exadata X2-2 Designed, built, upgraded and deployed/migrated the new Exadata V7 environment in just three months. DXC managed the overall project and the multiple parties involved. DXC Red Rock provisioned the technical elements of the new Exadata X7 infrastructure deployment, configuration and operational readiness.  Powering the world of financial services Client: Financial services company Location: Melbourne, Australia Industry: Banking & Financial Services Case Study: Financial Services This financial institution is on a journey to create a new world of financial services, challenging the status quo and looking for ways to be better; for its customers, partners and employees. A prominent financial services provider in Australia and New Zealand, the company’s major product line is consumer finance. The organisation offers personal loans, credit cards, car loans, and personal insurance; and partners with some of the region’s most iconic and successful retailers driving retail finance business. Challenge With an existing Oracle Exadata Database Machine and related services nearing end of life and approaching maximum performance capacity, the organisation required a solution to meet their future needs. Exadata runs all the company’s business critical database workloads including online transaction processing, data warehousing, and in-memory analytics which feed into credit collection solutions. This allows the financial services provider to service its consumers efficiently across the entire originations process, from new customer product origination to approval/ funds disbursal. Barely coping with current workloads, the company’s existing Exadata system (X2- 2) was five versions behind the current version (X7-2) and could not accommodate future growth. In addition, the organisation had planned a production data centre move, presenting the ideal opportunity to start fresh. The relocating and upgrading of an outdated platform also presented a high risk of outage to critical systems. The company required a tight cutover and minimal outage to ensure availability for key business as usual (BAU) operations. Solution Since DXC already supported the company’s full infrastructure stack, the team had first hand insight into the client’s business requirements. DXC proactively undertook careful evaluation of platform options in order to determine the best fit-for-purpose solution. Victor Lal, DXC’s Account General Manager said, “The planning process was highly iterative and collaborative. We worked very closely with the client to weigh up the options to produce the best outcome for their business.” The solution involved several vendors who were involved in the implementation. Managed overall by DXC, all parties worked in sync to run multiple activities in parallel.

Orals messaging starts early. You should consistently message to your customer throughout the pursuit, not just at orals. Developing effective messages early in a pursuit and maintaining continuality throughout a pursuit also allows the pursuit team to rally around the message. The repetition to the customer helps the message sink in. 3 Orals Process: Components Phase 3: Orals Step 7: Attend client presentation Step 8: Performance de-brief Phase 1: Preliminary orals Step 1: Assign orals coach Step 2: Execute messaging storyboard Step 3: Shape content Phase 2: Orals preparation Step 4: Orals prep Step 5: Orals rehearsal Step 6: Logistical support https://whatwesell.dxc.com/dxc/processes/orals-program/ October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential This is the Existing High-level Orals process flow – there is drill down detail available on each of these steps accessed thru the Interactive Orals Guide PowerPoint on the orals program website 4  Orals Leader Orals Manager Orals Coach DXC Client Team DXC SME Presenters Presentation & Design Specialist Preliminary Orals Participant Preparation Orals Preparation & Coaching Orals / Client Presentations Performance De-brief Assign Orals Coach - prepare workshop (including client insight/pursuit objectives content & managing team selection & invites) 1 Execute Messaging Storyboard (key client messages, value propositions, questions etc.) Conduct early in the sales process alongside solution storyboarding Use “Creating Messages that Matter” template 2 Collect Standard Graphic Content Shape Content and mediums for presenting (e.g. PowerPoint decks, visual aids and other supporting devices and collateral to meet requirements 3 Assist Presentation Team with logistical support & resources Lead Orals Client Preparation Workshop / Kick-off Scribe Workshop Facilitate/approve Workshop readiness Develop, practice run through key messages, solution overview, DXC service offerings including features and benefits, DXC differentiated value proposition, assign and practice worst client questions Attend workshop 4 Observe rehearsals & manage feedback process 5 Provide one-on-one coaching to presenters as necessary Participate in team rehearsals Provide graphics assistance 6 Attend client orals & present key messages, solution overview, DXC service offerings including features and benefits, DXC differentiated value proposition, participate in client Q&A 7 Provide graphics assistance Evaluate performance 8 Document strengths & weaknesses Provide feedback & adjust process Conduct Win/Loss review Out to Orals Preparation Process Out to Competitive Intelligence Act on feedback and improve future support in this area DXC Orals Process – ‘click & learn’ home (Interactive Guide) Provide logistical, branding assistance Client, Market & Competitive Intelligence Support Attend workshop Provide messaging, proofing assistance Marketing Support Key Roles Introduction October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 5 This is the Home Page slide of the Orals Interactive Guide located on the Orals Program Portal – use this as an interactive guide to learn more about the DXC Orals Process, roles & responsibilities, training available and various templates and checklists to support your pursuit.

Recognizing that the messaging will / can be refined / evolved as additional information is learned. We do a poor job articulating the benefits / examples / proof points to the client (Why / So What? What does this mean for the client?). We do OK talking about how DXC will perform the service – getting better with use cases and delivery involvement in orals (How we do). We do a good job talking about DXC (What we do)  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Say: The Orals Preparation period is split into three distinct and sequential periods. Do: Draw big outer box. Say: What – This is the time spent working on the message. What are you trying to say to the client? What is your message? If the team is effective at messaging, differentiation, gathering client insight, and developing delivery early in a pursuit (i.e. in Phase 1), determine what you are going to say is a simple revisit and refinement. The “What” section should take less than 15% of the time you have in “Phase 2 - Orals Preparation.” Do: Draw the first “What” box, and label it with message and 15%. Say: How – The second piece is “How.” How is your message going to be delivered to the client. This preparation step includes activities like the development of slides, deciding who is going to deliver the sections, developing the media, developing the handout, creating the graphics, gathering required data, reviewing all materials, developing videos, and individual practice. This should not take more than 35% of the orals preparation time. Do: Draw the “How” box and label the pieces. Say: Practice – The 3rd piece is practice. Effectively delivering your orals requires many different materials, people, and ideas coming together. The only way to assure you are going to get remarkable is to practice. This step is often skipped. It should take about 50% of the Phase 2 Orals Preparation time. Do: Draw “Practice” box. Say: If these are not done in sequence, you will run into tremendous inefficiencies. You will find people still trying to do messaging in the practice session. You will find people trying to create a message through a slide, or worse yet, your whole practice session will be spent tinkering with slides rather than making sure your message are well delivery. We are going to move through these three steps now. 12 Pre-content planning & preparation Find out who your audience is: The make-up of the audience and client agenda will dictate the level of detail & type of presentation.   Decide presenters/what they need to cover: Ensure all the customers requirements are covered & decide who will cover it.   Set a content lock down time: Set lockdown so slides are finished with enough time to fine tune & practice the presentation. At least 1 full day. Make schedule at the start: Following a plan with deadlines gives everyone full visibility & keeps project on track.  Step 3: Shape content October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Review agenda / expectations with client – ensure we “really” understand what they are asking for in an agenda topic. Need to do a better job planning (Bid Management) for orals prep earlier in the process. Teams spend too much time worrying about what slide looks like versus messaging (Suncor, others) and rehearsals. (Solution / Delivery teams) need additional training “storytelling” (i.e. Articulus storyboard, DEW, Step). Bid manager/ coordinator / Pursuit Engagement Manager (PEM)– schedules meetings / sessions / calendar invites – Coach typically lead the session – check with pursuit leaders – some may prefer to take the lead – again – set expectations up-front and determine the best approach For more complex interactions / orals – divide and conquer – Example: Coach may lead Q&A role plays –experienced industry consultant / pursuit leader lead presentation / initial messaging break-outs – then swap – Coach then leads presentation role play by tower / full rehearsals and industry consultant / pursuit leader role plays Q&A during rehearsals 13 Who is the target audience? SOCIAL STYLES? Individual Profile Decision maker? October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Say: We are preparing for a very specific event: Orals. Who is your audience for this event? Yes, the customer may be sending 20 people to the event, but who are we targeting with our message. Once we know who we are targeting, we can make sure our message matches the target audience. We can make sure our value propositions are properly constructed. Do: Reveal Decision Maker Say: Who is the decision maker(s)? Maybe the Decision Grid would help here… Do: Reveal Social Styles Say: Understanding the type of person that you are targeting with making sure you have the right type of message. So, use your social styles information. Do: Reveal Profile. Say: Of course, the individual profiles you created in pre orals will be invaluable here. Everyone, especially new people to the pursuit, should use the profiles to understand the audience members they are specifically targeting. At the end of the day, if you are going to be an effective messager, you have to know who you are delivering the message to. 14 Sample Work-plan  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Orals Prep / work session – Detailed Schedule -

FFS Set regular check points: Presenters can show the rest of the team their content to add ideas & ensures that the work is on track. Prepare answers for difficult questions: Circumvent questions that may undermine our presentation & have our best possible answer ready. Set time / slide limits for each presenter: Ensure presenters cover most important messages & don’t waste time producing too much content.

Remove or tweak irrelevant content.  Presentation building Create value / benefits graphic: Open & close presentation with a slide that has all key benefits to client identified in simple graphic.  Proof points & testimonials are vital: Add credibility to our claims by referencing examples and personal experiences that prove our track record & reliability. Don’t put too much info on slides: Keep the slides headline / visual based & allow the presenter to add the details verbally.    Step 4: Orals prep October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Talk about the client first, not DXC…..Teams spend too much time worrying about what slide looks like versus messaging and rehearsals. (Solution / Delivery teams) need additional training “storytelling” (i.e. Articulus storyboard, DEW, Step). 20  Contain costs Create outcomes Provide hardened systems and networks Manage and mitigate risk  Efficiently host workloads and services Continuously create and deliver new services  Store and manage data  Software automates business systems Software differentiates products and services Provide real-time insight and understanding SAMPLE - Creating value for CLIENT XYZ by bridging traditional and new CLIENT XYZ October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 21 Plan & practice Q&A session: Set owners of all client questions & practice how the team will answer them in the Q&A session.   Dry runs / rehearsals Make sure you have multiple dry runs: Practice is crucial to ensure the presentation is effective, slides mean nothing if poorly presented.    Be constructive with your critique: We want as much feedback as possible but it must be positive & constructive to build presenter up.  Feedback is the only way to improve: Don’t be afraid of the group’s critique, safe environment, embrace it as part of the process that is key to improving our story.  Step 5: Orals rehearsal October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 22 Objectives of rehearsal Help instill the confidence & motivation your team needs need to make a memorable and successful presentation. Rehearse presentation 2-3 times as appropriate – this should help team members be more relaxed & comfortable when presenting to the client. Helps to ensures that your presentation is bringing the value to your client that you have defined and differentiate us from the competition. Best practice structure that will help avoid working on a PowerPoint slide deck until wee hours of the morning on the day of your presentation. Teams should practices multiple times for key presentations October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential What are Orals rehearsals? Rehearsals are not: Rehearsals are: A place where leadership and/or stakeholders are evaluating you as a person. A one day meeting prior to the client interaction – an event that can be skipped, shortened or not taken seriously. A place where you need to show off to your in-depth skills and knowledge to your co-workers. Optional – If you want to succeed. A journey of multiple days & weeks. A constructive environment that will help team members evolve & improve as a presenters. Vital to helping the team deliver the best possible presentation. A place where everyone should be focused on helping differentiate us from the competition to win business for DXC. October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Teams spend too much time worrying about what slide looks like versus messaging (Suncor, others) and rehearsals. (Solution / Delivery teams) need additional training “storytelling” (i.e. Articulus storyboard, DEW, Step). 24 Be confident & positive when speaking: Don’t use any negative or uncertain language, if we don’t act like we believe in ourselves why will they? Presentation delivery tips Don’t read your presentation delivery: Presenters should concentrate on delivering key messages rather than trying to recall their notes word for word.  Control info flow on slides with clicks: Control audience attention by using clicks to ensure relevant info hidden until you want to talk about it.     1 2 3 It’s not about us, it’s about them: Don’t tell the audience about how good DXC is, tell them how working with DXC will benefit them and meet their needs. Step 5: Orals rehearsal October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential “I think we can do that…” Uh we can do that”…..WE WILL DO THAT…..Show Youtube video here Teams spend too much time worrying about what slide looks like versus messaging (Suncor, others) and rehearsals. (Solution / Delivery teams) need additional training “storytelling” (i.e. Articulus storyboard, DEW, Step). 25 Maximizing delivery impact Additional printed material & handouts: Unless requested, recommend deck handouts be given after presentation, if before they can be a distraction to audience. Know your attendees.  A0 printing for walls of room: Important graphics can be put on the walls around the room so audience can examine them. A0 Aligned with the client meeting agenda: Replicate the presentation environment in the dry runs, for example simultaneous sessions.       Finish at reasonable time the night before: If you need to work late do it before the final day, you need to be relaxed & rested before you present. Step 5: Orals rehearsal October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Wall Posters – Bad Good – masking tape on outside? Pay attention to details – Expect the unexpected at client sites / improvise 26 Flipchart/Whiteboard Drawing Role Play Slides with graphics Posters Physical Object Stories Handouts  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Say: Here are some ways to communicate your idea during an orals. Slides – Slides can and likely should be used. But how? Stop with the all text slides. Those are not effective. Use pictures and graphics. Integrate sound. Integrate video. Flip Chart and Whiteboard – Use the flip chart. It has some advantages. Just by using it your message will be more interesting at that point. It is a change! But, more importantly, using a flip chart gives the speaker more credibility. The audience believes that by drawing the concept the speaker truly understands it. It gets the speaker a way to connect with the audience. This is critical for delivery. Poster – Print up large posters. This allows some of your ideas to be persistent around the room. It forces the speaker to move. Handouts – Do you really need to handout your slides? Make the handout something that supplements the speaker. Maybe it is some data, or an article. Video – Videos can make the room come alive. They are a great way to add visuals to your message. The key is to limit the length of the video. Remember, you are the presenter, not the video. Try to keep the videos less than 60 second long. That way you can add the detail and you still have control of the message. Physical Objects – Is there something you can have physically in the room which adds to your message. Maybe and PDA with a real time dashboard. Maybe a symbolic object or an award you have won. Role Plays – Rather than show the audience a slides explaining a process, act it out for them. Narratives – Turn off the slides and tell me a personal story of what you have done. There does not always have to be something on the screen. Delivery it from the heart. 27 Visual Storyboard – An iterative process  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Solution Overview (3’ x 6’ Wallboard) - Final  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Ongoing management Ensure we don’t drift away from what the client wants, keep checking our story against their requirements. Continually refer back to client’s BO’s: BO DXC Solution If we are unable to stick to original timeline for any reason, reorganize to get back on track ASAP. Be proactive & adaptive in your planning: Brief in advance any external participants so they arrive with a good understanding of the objectives. Brief the external dry run participants:  Ensure the team can be completely focused on the task at hand by removing any potential stress or distractions. Remove distractions, maximize focus: Step 5: Orals rehearsal October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Expect the unexpected – last minute client requests, changes 30 Logistics  Ensure team members know where to be / when / dress code DXC Corporate Meeting Booking – Fill-out Meeting Registration / Executive Briefing request Reserve Hotel Rooms; Conference, Meeting, and Hotel Plan meals (team dinner, practice sessions, and at Orals prep location) Plan beverage and snacks for Orals practice / rehearsal session(s) Obtain shipping address of the hotel for practice/prep and Orals sessions Order additional copies of the DXC Response to the RFP (for practice sessions) Produce copies of presentations, videos, CDs Produce copies of handouts / materials / team booklet Order Give-Away Items (consult DXC Legal as appropriate) Have team update their travel itineraries in a designated location (i.e. SharePoint spreadsheet) Arrange to ship Orals support materials to and from the Orals location Locate printing/copy/reproductions facilities near Orals location (if needed) Print directions and map from airport to the hotel and/or Orals locations As applicable, following are some logistical activities to consider: Step 6: Logistics October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Expect the unexpected – last minute client requests, changes 31 Attend Client Presentation Best Practice Guidelines – Do’s and Don’ts Orals Coaching Section Step 7: Attend client presentation  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Expect the unexpected – last minute client requests, changes 32 Best Practices Establish connection with client How well our DXC team works together Interaction with client, all attendees – We should not get all hung up about just targeting or aligning our delivery/messages to only the decision makers…we may not know the real importance of each attendee’s role or influence by their title alone Try to dispel (or not create or perpetuate) the image that DXC is rigid – Here is where we can illustrate our Cultural Fit…Be creative, have fun, let our personalities shine through Utilize visual aids, such as Wall Charts and Graphics as tools to draw attention and invite meaningful 2-way dialogues and interactions with the client – Try to have at least 20% of the meeting where client is interacting or sharing info with us Need to articulate what our solution really means to the client – how it is aligned to help them achieve their business objectives…think of explaining each solution element with “which means”…to Regeneron, so they can really grasp and understand the benefit to them… We need to clearly articulate our Key Differentiators so they stand out and resonate with the clients in the room – for example, things like Flexibility and Global Scale are NOT key differentiators…all of our competitors can say the same thing…Some examples for us to highlight – DXC value/benefits, Partner Ecosystem, Industry Experience/Expertise, etc…Need to give evidence and examples Presenters need to be prepared to get into the details our of our solution – e.g. T&T plans, Tools, etc. in order to instill and increase confidence in our ability to deliver Bring energy and enthusiasm, especially being one of the last presentations they will see – NOTE: being one of the last up is a good spot to be in… Also be ready to present options to illustrate our adaptability and knowledge/expertise – but need to be clear about what is included in our solution and what is not (don’t mislead the client). Lead in with something like “Have you thought about…” Additional Notes: Ideally, our Dry Runs + Rehearsals with critiques should be more challenging than the actual client session October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential  ",0,Orals Process: Interactive Guide,0,"Orals Experience Leader, presenters, coaching Orals is quite possibly the single most important client interaction of the sales engagement.

Orals messaging starts early. You should consistently message to your customer throughout the pursuit, not just at orals. Developing effective messages early in a pursuit and maintaining continuality throughout a pursuit also allows the pursuit team to rally around the message. The repetition to the customer helps the message sink in. 3 Orals Process: Components Phase 3: Orals Step 7: Attend client presentation Step 8: Performance de-brief Phase 1: Preliminary orals Step 1: Assign orals coach Step 2: Execute messaging storyboard Step 3: Shape content Phase 2: Orals preparation Step 4: Orals prep Step 5: Orals rehearsal Step 6: Logistical support https://whatwesell.dxc.com/dxc/processes/orals-program/ October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential This is the Existing High-level Orals process flow – there is drill down detail available on each of these steps accessed thru the Interactive Orals Guide PowerPoint on the orals program website 4  Orals Leader Orals Manager Orals Coach DXC Client Team DXC SME Presenters Presentation & Design Specialist Preliminary Orals Participant Preparation Orals Preparation & Coaching Orals / Client Presentations Performance De-brief Assign Orals Coach - prepare workshop (including client insight/pursuit objectives content & managing team selection & invites) 1 Execute Messaging Storyboard (key client messages, value propositions, questions etc.) Conduct early in the sales process alongside solution storyboarding Use “Creating Messages that Matter” template 2 Collect Standard Graphic Content Shape Content and mediums for presenting (e.g. PowerPoint decks, visual aids and other supporting devices and collateral to meet requirements 3 Assist Presentation Team with logistical support & resources Lead Orals Client Preparation Workshop / Kick-off Scribe Workshop Facilitate/approve Workshop readiness Develop, practice run through key messages, solution overview, DXC service offerings including features and benefits, DXC differentiated value proposition, assign and practice worst client questions Attend workshop 4 Observe rehearsals & manage feedback process 5 Provide one-on-one coaching to presenters as necessary Participate in team rehearsals Provide graphics assistance 6 Attend client orals & present key messages, solution overview, DXC service offerings including features and benefits, DXC differentiated value proposition, participate in client Q&A 7 Provide graphics assistance Evaluate performance 8 Document strengths & weaknesses Provide feedback & adjust process Conduct Win/Loss review Out to Orals Preparation Process Out to Competitive Intelligence Act on feedback and improve future support in this area DXC Orals Process – ‘click & learn’ home (Interactive Guide) Provide logistical, branding assistance Client, Market & Competitive Intelligence Support Attend workshop Provide messaging, proofing assistance Marketing Support Key Roles Introduction October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 5 This is the Home Page slide of the Orals Interactive Guide located on the Orals Program Portal – use this as an interactive guide to learn more about the DXC Orals Process, roles & responsibilities, training available and various templates and checklists to support your pursuit.

Benefits / Value to client Case studies / Examples / Proof Points Messaging  Executive summary Orals Site visits Step 2: Execute messaging storyboard October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential The concept of the “Messaging Approach” is that our messaging to our clients (What, How, Why) should be consistent throughout the pursuit from proposal/exec summary to orals to site visits. Recognizing that the messaging will / can be refined / evolved as additional information is learned. We do a poor job articulating the benefits / examples / proof points to the client (Why / So What? What does this mean for the client?). We do OK talking about how DXC will perform the service – getting better with use cases and delivery involvement in orals (How we do). We do a good job talking about DXC (What we do)  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Say: The Orals Preparation period is split into three distinct and sequential periods. Do: Draw big outer box. Say: What – This is the time spent working on the message. What are you trying to say to the client? What is your message? If the team is effective at messaging, differentiation, gathering client insight, and developing delivery early in a pursuit (i.e. in Phase 1), determine what you are going to say is a simple revisit and refinement. The “What” section should take less than 15% of the time you have in “Phase 2 - Orals Preparation.” Do: Draw the first “What” box, and label it with message and 15%. Say: How – The second piece is “How.” How is your message going to be delivered to the client. This preparation step includes activities like the development of slides, deciding who is going to deliver the sections, developing the media, developing the handout, creating the graphics, gathering required data, reviewing all materials, developing videos, and individual practice. This should not take more than 35% of the orals preparation time. Do: Draw the “How” box and label the pieces. Say: Practice – The 3rd piece is practice. Effectively delivering your orals requires many different materials, people, and ideas coming together. The only way to assure you are going to get remarkable is to practice. This step is often skipped. It should take about 50% of the Phase 2 Orals Preparation time. Do: Draw “Practice” box. Say: If these are not done in sequence, you will run into tremendous inefficiencies. You will find people still trying to do messaging in the practice session. You will find people trying to create a message through a slide, or worse yet, your whole practice session will be spent tinkering with slides rather than making sure your message are well delivery. We are going to move through these three steps now. 12 Pre-content planning & preparation Find out who your audience is: The make-up of the audience and client agenda will dictate the level of detail & type of presentation.   Decide presenters/what they need to cover: Ensure all the customers requirements are covered & decide who will cover it.   Set a content lock down time: Set lockdown so slides are finished with enough time to fine tune & practice the presentation. At least 1 full day. Make schedule at the start: Following a plan with deadlines gives everyone full visibility & keeps project on track.  Step 3: Shape content October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Review agenda / expectations with client – ensure we “really” understand what they are asking for in an agenda topic. Need to do a better job planning (Bid Management) for orals prep earlier in the process. Teams spend too much time worrying about what slide looks like versus messaging (Suncor, others) and rehearsals. (Solution / Delivery teams) need additional training “storytelling” (i.e. Articulus storyboard, DEW, Step). Bid manager/ coordinator / Pursuit Engagement Manager (PEM)– schedules meetings / sessions / calendar invites – Coach typically lead the session – check with pursuit leaders – some may prefer to take the lead – again – set expectations up-front and determine the best approach For more complex interactions / orals – divide and conquer – Example: Coach may lead Q&A role plays –experienced industry consultant / pursuit leader lead presentation / initial messaging break-outs – then swap – Coach then leads presentation role play by tower / full rehearsals and industry consultant / pursuit leader role plays Q&A during rehearsals 13 Who is the target audience? SOCIAL STYLES? Individual Profile Decision maker? October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Say: We are preparing for a very specific event: Orals. Who is your audience for this event? Yes, the customer may be sending 20 people to the event, but who are we targeting with our message. Once we know who we are targeting, we can make sure our message matches the target audience. We can make sure our value propositions are properly constructed. Do: Reveal Decision Maker Say: Who is the decision maker(s)? Maybe the Decision Grid would help here… Do: Reveal Social Styles Say: Understanding the type of person that you are targeting with making sure you have the right type of message. So, use your social styles information. Do: Reveal Profile. Say: Of course, the individual profiles you created in pre orals will be invaluable here. Everyone, especially new people to the pursuit, should use the profiles to understand the audience members they are specifically targeting. At the end of the day, if you are going to be an effective messager, you have to know who you are delivering the message to. 14 Sample Work-plan  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Orals Prep / work session – Detailed Schedule -

FFS Set regular check points: Presenters can show the rest of the team their content to add ideas & ensures that the work is on track. Prepare answers for difficult questions: Circumvent questions that may undermine our presentation & have our best possible answer ready. Set time / slide limits for each presenter: Ensure presenters cover most important messages & don’t waste time producing too much content.

Remove or tweak irrelevant content.  Presentation building Create value / benefits graphic: Open & close presentation with a slide that has all key benefits to client identified in simple graphic.  Proof points & testimonials are vital: Add credibility to our claims by referencing examples and personal experiences that prove our track record & reliability. Don’t put too much info on slides: Keep the slides headline / visual based & allow the presenter to add the details verbally.    Step 4: Orals prep October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Talk about the client first, not DXC…..Teams spend too much time worrying about what slide looks like versus messaging and rehearsals. (Solution / Delivery teams) need additional training “storytelling” (i.e. Articulus storyboard, DEW, Step). 20  Contain costs Create outcomes Provide hardened systems and networks Manage and mitigate risk  Efficiently host workloads and services Continuously create and deliver new services  Store and manage data  Software automates business systems Software differentiates products and services Provide real-time insight and understanding SAMPLE - Creating value for CLIENT XYZ by bridging traditional and new CLIENT XYZ October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 21 Plan & practice Q&A session: Set owners of all client questions & practice how the team will answer them in the Q&A session.   Dry runs / rehearsals Make sure you have multiple dry runs: Practice is crucial to ensure the presentation is effective, slides mean nothing if poorly presented.    Be constructive with your critique: We want as much feedback as possible but it must be positive & constructive to build presenter up.  Feedback is the only way to improve: Don’t be afraid of the group’s critique, safe environment, embrace it as part of the process that is key to improving our story.  Step 5: Orals rehearsal October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 22 Objectives of rehearsal Help instill the confidence & motivation your team needs need to make a memorable and successful presentation. Rehearse presentation 2-3 times as appropriate – this should help team members be more relaxed & comfortable when presenting to the client. Helps to ensures that your presentation is bringing the value to your client that you have defined and differentiate us from the competition. Best practice structure that will help avoid working on a PowerPoint slide deck until wee hours of the morning on the day of your presentation. Teams should practices multiple times for key presentations October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential What are Orals rehearsals? Rehearsals are not: Rehearsals are: A place where leadership and/or stakeholders are evaluating you as a person. A one day meeting prior to the client interaction – an event that can be skipped, shortened or not taken seriously. A place where you need to show off to your in-depth skills and knowledge to your co-workers. Optional – If you want to succeed. A journey of multiple days & weeks. A constructive environment that will help team members evolve & improve as a presenters. Vital to helping the team deliver the best possible presentation. A place where everyone should be focused on helping differentiate us from the competition to win business for DXC. October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Teams spend too much time worrying about what slide looks like versus messaging (Suncor, others) and rehearsals. (Solution / Delivery teams) need additional training “storytelling” (i.e. Articulus storyboard, DEW, Step). 24 Be confident & positive when speaking: Don’t use any negative or uncertain language, if we don’t act like we believe in ourselves why will they? Presentation delivery tips Don’t read your presentation delivery: Presenters should concentrate on delivering key messages rather than trying to recall their notes word for word.  Control info flow on slides with clicks: Control audience attention by using clicks to ensure relevant info hidden until you want to talk about it.     1 2 3 It’s not about us, it’s about them: Don’t tell the audience about how good DXC is, tell them how working with DXC will benefit them and meet their needs. Step 5: Orals rehearsal October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential “I think we can do that…” Uh we can do that”…..WE WILL DO THAT…..Show Youtube video here Teams spend too much time worrying about what slide looks like versus messaging (Suncor, others) and rehearsals. (Solution / Delivery teams) need additional training “storytelling” (i.e. Articulus storyboard, DEW, Step). 25 Maximizing delivery impact Additional printed material & handouts: Unless requested, recommend deck handouts be given after presentation, if before they can be a distraction to audience. Know your attendees.  A0 printing for walls of room: Important graphics can be put on the walls around the room so audience can examine them. A0 Aligned with the client meeting agenda: Replicate the presentation environment in the dry runs, for example simultaneous sessions.       Finish at reasonable time the night before: If you need to work late do it before the final day, you need to be relaxed & rested before you present. Step 5: Orals rehearsal October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Wall Posters – Bad Good – masking tape on outside? Pay attention to details – Expect the unexpected at client sites / improvise 26 Flipchart/Whiteboard Drawing Role Play Slides with graphics Posters Physical Object Stories Handouts  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Say: Here are some ways to communicate your idea during an orals. Slides – Slides can and likely should be used. But how? Stop with the all text slides. Those are not effective. Use pictures and graphics. Integrate sound. Integrate video. Flip Chart and Whiteboard – Use the flip chart. It has some advantages. Just by using it your message will be more interesting at that point. It is a change! But, more importantly, using a flip chart gives the speaker more credibility. The audience believes that by drawing the concept the speaker truly understands it. It gets the speaker a way to connect with the audience. This is critical for delivery. Poster – Print up large posters. This allows some of your ideas to be persistent around the room. It forces the speaker to move. Handouts – Do you really need to handout your slides? Make the handout something that supplements the speaker. Maybe it is some data, or an article. Video – Videos can make the room come alive. They are a great way to add visuals to your message. The key is to limit the length of the video. Remember, you are the presenter, not the video. Try to keep the videos less than 60 second long. That way you can add the detail and you still have control of the message. Physical Objects – Is there something you can have physically in the room which adds to your message. Maybe and PDA with a real time dashboard. Maybe a symbolic object or an award you have won. Role Plays – Rather than show the audience a slides explaining a process, act it out for them. Narratives – Turn off the slides and tell me a personal story of what you have done. There does not always have to be something on the screen. Delivery it from the heart. 27 Visual Storyboard – An iterative process  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Solution Overview (3’ x 6’ Wallboard) - Final  October 23, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Ongoing management Ensure we don’t drift away from what the client wants, keep checking our story against their requirements. Continually refer back to client’s BO’s: BO DXC Solution If we are unable to stick to original timeline for any reason, reorganize to get back on track ASAP. Be proactive & adaptive in your planning: Brief in advance any external participants so they arrive with a good understanding of the objectives. Brief the external dry run participants:  Ensure the team can be completely focused on the task at hand by removing any potential stress or distractions.

Create, scan, track and retain documentation within the same system. • Refrigerator management. Physical representation of mortuary refrigerators on screen with visible patient contents and key information enforces refrigeration management, such as disinfection processes, before the unit can be used again. Organizations can restrict refrigerator access if necessary. • Reporting. Custom-built reports and statistics can show workload and bottlenecks. • Audit. Full documentation on all actions with the patient/deceased and their belongings: Everything is time-, date- and user-stamped for all audit trails and reports. • Alerts and warnings. Alerts can help protect staff from infections and other risks and ensure that mitigation action is taken, if needed. Warnings can be used to enforce patient and family wishes. • Role-based access. Role-based access control ensures that the correct access level and correct data are available to the right person and role. For example, a bereavement officer, a pathologist and a hospital porter will have different data views and access levels. • Integration.

cl-115791,N/A,whatwesell.dxc.com,AI autonomous vehicles deterministic learning training machine learning,,,,0,White Paper,2019-10-17T05:00:00Z,"Current training models for autonomous driving development have effectively achieved SAE Level 3, but for autonomous vehicles to reach SAE Level 5 full autonomy, AV engineers must develop a driving agent that learns like a human. Explore the associated data challenges and potential for human-based learning approaches.","  Making AI smart enough for autonomous vehicles White Paper Making AI smart enough for autonomous vehicles A mix of computer science companies, leading tech firms and worldwide automakers are working hard to create a next- generation artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) that will make fully autonomous vehicles a reality. Already, luxury car makers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus and Tesla, and tech firms such as Google and Microsoft, have sophisticated advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) that can provide an autonomous experience in urban environments up to SAE Level 3. These systems cover a few driving situations based on narrow drive requirements, though all still rely on human intervention in a stressful situation or in the event of an imminent accident. As of spring 2019, the European Union’s Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, said she expects fully autonomous driving capabilities to arrive by 2030.1 The European Road Transport Research Advisory Council2, however, predicts these capabilities will not arrive until after 2030. To achieve full autonomy — a state in which the vehicle can navigate itself through any terrain in any conditions it’s necessary to take AI approaches to the next level, with driving agents that implement human driving behavior by collecting driver demonstrations that optimize driving policy for unknown or unpredictable situations. This requires enormous amounts of data, so data engineers must find ways to eliminate the processing of so-called “boring” data that will not help the system develop better driving strategies. For truly safe and secure autonomous driving that delivers on the promise of fewer accidents and enhanced sustainability, autonomous vehicles must be able to sift out extraneous data so they can make driving decisions better and faster than humans — 100 percent of the time. Smart road infrastructure attempts to address this problem by delivering only the data needed, but it also creates a dependency that inhibits development of a truly autonomous vehicle. The data, compute and AI issues ahead are extremely challenging. But the upside is tremendous, because autonomous cars have great potential to save lives. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)3 contends that automated vehicles can reduce injuries based on one critical fact: 94 percent of serious auto crashes are caused by human error. Autonomous vehicles promise to eliminate a big part of human error from the crash equation, which will help protect drivers and passengers, as well as bicyclists and pedestrians. 1 Forbes, April 6, 2019: “Self-driving cars in 10 years: EU Expects ‘Fully Automated’ cars by 2030” 2 Forbes, May 21, 2019: “Self-Driving Automobiles: How Soon and How Much?” 3 NHSTA: “Automated Vehicles for Safety” White Paper 2 https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/04/06/self-driving-cars-in-10-years-eu-expects-fully-automated-cars-by-2030/#3975a2e9615b https://www.forbes.com/sites/uhenergy/2019/05/21/self-driving-automobiles-how-soon-and-how-much/#5ba8971938bd https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety Disrupting the status quo Today, extensive preparation4 is underway, with about half of the U.S. states testing autonomous vehicles on public roads. Most of the testing is in Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Texas, Pennsylvania and Washington. California has emerged as the busiest state, with 52 companies testing autonomous vehicles in The Golden State alone. A new approach to AI begins with a baseline autonomous driving platform that enables driving behavior engineers to establish driver behavior knowledge that can be refined to simulate how an intelligent driving agent (the autonomous car) would respond in real-world situations. With this process, engineers can aid the intelligent driving agent to learn driving behavior and build driving functions and recall that information over time, similar to human learning. Developing AI driving agents to learn Today, computer scientists experiment with different types of approaches, architecture and training strategies in their incorporation of AI and ML — all of which will play a role in the development of autonomous vehicles over the next decade or two. The main AI/ML theories relevant for teaching an autonomous driving agent include these: 1. Brain science. One of the possible approaches to build better AI driver agents draws its inspiration from brain science research conducted by Danko Nikolic at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS) in Germany. Nikolic, in the Practopoiesis,5 theorizes that humans actually learn at three levels: trial and error (accumulating knowledge throughout evolution); learning how to learn; and finally, putting the knowledge into action. It’s the second level in which humans “learn how to learn” that Nikolic considers the most important application in applying AI to autonomous driving. If we can discover more about how humans learn, there is greater potential for AI as it applies to autonomous cars and for education in general. Nikolic’s theory maintains that we must teach AI technology to learn the way humans do.  Adapting this theory to AI in the automotive realm starts by building driving- learning agents capable of learning the way humans do, then creating small, fast- learner training sets from human driver demonstrations. The concept of adapting innovative brain research to AI and the production of fully autonomous vehicles has emerged as one of the more exciting technology innovations in the past couple of years. While it will take time, the benefits to society of producing self-driving vehicles — and learning more about how the brain works along the way — hold great promise for human progress. The brain science approach can potentially take the best of human learning and develop the best AI driver agent for the automotive field, but the research can take several years, and it’s difficult to adapt it into the production of autonomous driving. 4 Curbed.com, March 8, 2019: “Are self-driving cars safe for our cities?” 5 Danko Nikolic, “Practopoiesis” Autonomous vehicles must be able to sift out extraneous data so they can make driving decisions better and faster than humans — 100 percent of the time. White Paper 3 https://www.curbed.com/2016/9/21/12991696/driverless-cars-safety-pros-cons http://www.danko-nikolic.com/practopoiesis/ 2. Imitation learning. In this type of approach, the AI learner first observes the actions of the driving expert, often a human, in supervised learning. The AI learner then uses this training set to learn a policy that tries to mimic the actions demonstrated by the expert to achieve the best performance. In practice, the AI imitation learning agent would observe a human expert driver and register the driver’s actions over time, recording how he or she makes right and left turns, stops at stop signs and accelerates on the open highway. Based on those tracked results, the agent would create a policy of what actions to take for any given situation based on what the expert did. At a run-time test, it would compute the best action based on the developed policy. Over time, the system develops a network of best cases and, based on experience, it theoretically would always pick the best option based on a deterministic policy model in a context of inference. Imitation learning leverages the benefits of supervised learning, but struggles with an important issue: how to collect expert driving situations and sum up steering errors in a way that allows the driving agent to handle off-course situations that it has never dealt with before, while keeping safety as one of its major principles. It’s possible to overcome this problem, but it requires advanced autonomous driving technology, a full team of expert technologists and lots of time. 3. Reinforcement learning. With this type of learning, there’s no expert, human or otherwise; it’s based on unsupervised learning. The agent is assigned a reward function and uses various strategies to effectively explore the different states and actions on the road. Via trial and error, it comes up with the optimum policy. In reinforcement learning, we try to maximize the rewards for the agent’s actions. In driving mode (model inference), the reinforcement learning agent executes the agent’s model for every event and passes with no issues. However, if during a test the car crashes or hits a pedestrian or another car in a simulation, the task ends with negative rewards. The agent will then start with random actions, and through trial and error learn which actions maximize rewards and which actions result in a positive maximized score. When reinforcement learning works well, if the car runs into a tree, it will learn not to do that again and will then avoid repeating that mistake. The main challenges of the reinforcement learning are the low stability in behavior and high dependency on the size of the environment and the computer processing power. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting Neural networks are computer systems designed to behave as a human brain; however, being artificial does not mean they do not forget. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the catastrophic loss of previously learned driving knowledge whenever neural networks are trained with a single new additional response. Under the theory of catastrophic forgetting, depending on the architecture, the agent neural network can only run a small number of scenarios before its performance rapidly decreases. Today, if a team puts more test scenarios on a neural network, it will top out at a certain threshold. In application today, nobody really knows how to fix this except to add scenario classifier input and preconditions to the driving behavior agent. However, based on probability theory, this decreases accuracy. Resolving catastrophic forgetting promises to take autonomous driving to the highest possible level — fully autonomous driving. White Paper 4 Driving behavior data engineers, computer scientists, and AI scientists and researchers must find the proper design — or even new AI approaches — to develop fully autonomous driving. There’s currently research in the United States and China addressing this challenge, but until this issue of catastrophic forgetting is overcome, it will not be possible to address fully autonomous driving through one unified behavior model. Research has begun on how to avoid catastrophic forgetting, but there is no definitive method to expand the ability to train and manage end-to-end unlimited scenarios. This is very important; if a neural network forgets what it has learned based on previous experiences, autonomous vehicles would have to stick with the existing rule-based programming model and never reach full autonomy. Resolving catastrophic forgetting promises to take autonomous driving to the highest possible level, fully autonomous driving. But it’s very complex and difficult to get an AI driving agent past a certain threshold. Around the corner Industry observers often wonder which of these AI approaches will prevail in the long run. Most likely, we’ll see some of all four used over the next two decades. Driving behavior data engineers, computer scientists, and AI scientists and researchers must find the proper design — or even new AI approaches — to develop fully autonomous driving. However, as we run more tests, we will know more about learning how to learn and how to generalize and evolve as we gain knowledge. The challenge of getting autonomous driving behavior to the next level presents too many data and processing issues for us to grapple with all of human intelligence. Humankind has yet to create a storage facility that can collect and hold all that data. But if computer scientists and industry researchers stay focused on AI agents for autonomous driving, we can overcome many of these challenges and we’ll begin seeing the first wave of fully autonomous vehicles that will offer higher levels of autonomous driving functions in the near future. All this new autonomous driving technology will be developed on back-end autonomous driving platforms that include compute, data lake, unified security, fully managed development security operations (DevSecOps), metadata management and governance, and a high-performance network. Any enhanced AI system will have to handle hundreds, if not thousands, of petabytes of data and at least thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs). The computer industry has begun to address many of these data storage and processing performance needs. We will continue to make bigger and faster computers but mastering the power of AI and applying it to autonomous driving will keep automotive computer science engineers busy for decades. It’s one of the great challenges of our generation. 6 All the AI approaches outlined in this paper are specific and focused on human driving behavior capabilities. While the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI) targets a different science and research area and technologists can apply it to multiple industries and business processes, the approaches outlined in this paper focus solely on driving an autonomous car.

The AI learner then uses this training set to learn a policy that tries to mimic the actions demonstrated by the expert to achieve the best performance. In practice, the AI imitation learning agent would observe a human expert driver and register the driver’s actions over time, recording how he or she makes right and left turns, stops at stop signs and accelerates on the open highway. Based on those tracked results, the agent would create a policy of what actions to take for any given situation based on what the expert did. At a run-time test, it would compute the best action based on the developed policy. Over time, the system develops a network of best cases and, based on experience, it theoretically would always pick the best option based on a deterministic policy model in a context of inference. Imitation learning leverages the benefits of supervised learning, but struggles with an important issue: how to collect expert driving situations and sum up steering errors in a way that allows the driving agent to handle off-course situations that it has never dealt with before, while keeping safety as one of its major principles. It’s possible to overcome this problem, but it requires advanced autonomous driving technology, a full team of expert technologists and lots of time. 3. Reinforcement learning. With this type of learning, there’s no expert, human or otherwise; it’s based on unsupervised learning. The agent is assigned a reward function and uses various strategies to effectively explore the different states and actions on the road. Via trial and error, it comes up with the optimum policy. In reinforcement learning, we try to maximize the rewards for the agent’s actions. In driving mode (model inference), the reinforcement learning agent executes the agent’s model for every event and passes with no issues. However, if during a test the car crashes or hits a pedestrian or another car in a simulation, the task ends with negative rewards. The agent will then start with random actions, and through trial and error learn which actions maximize rewards and which actions result in a positive maximized score. When reinforcement learning works well, if the car runs into a tree, it will learn not to do that again and will then avoid repeating that mistake. The main challenges of the reinforcement learning are the low stability in behavior and high dependency on the size of the environment and the computer processing power. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting Neural networks are computer systems designed to behave as a human brain; however, being artificial does not mean they do not forget. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the catastrophic loss of previously learned driving knowledge whenever neural networks are trained with a single new additional response. Under the theory of catastrophic forgetting, depending on the architecture, the agent neural network can only run a small number of scenarios before its performance rapidly decreases. Today, if a team puts more test scenarios on a neural network, it will top out at a certain threshold. In application today, nobody really knows how to fix this except to add scenario classifier input and preconditions to the driving behavior agent. However, based on probability theory, this decreases accuracy. Resolving catastrophic forgetting promises to take autonomous driving to the highest possible level — fully autonomous driving. White Paper 4 Driving behavior data engineers, computer scientists, and AI scientists and researchers must find the proper design — or even new AI approaches — to develop fully autonomous driving. There’s currently research in the United States and China addressing this challenge, but until this issue of catastrophic forgetting is overcome, it will not be possible to address fully autonomous driving through one unified behavior model. Research has begun on how to avoid catastrophic forgetting, but there is no definitive method to expand the ability to train and manage end-to-end unlimited scenarios. This is very important; if a neural network forgets what it has learned based on previous experiences, autonomous vehicles would have to stick with the existing rule-based programming model and never reach full autonomy. Resolving catastrophic forgetting promises to take autonomous driving to the highest possible level, fully autonomous driving. But it’s very complex and difficult to get an AI driving agent past a certain threshold. Around the corner Industry observers often wonder which of these AI approaches will prevail in the long run. Most likely, we’ll see some of all four used over the next two decades. Driving behavior data engineers, computer scientists, and AI scientists and researchers must find the proper design — or even new AI approaches — to develop fully autonomous driving. However, as we run more tests, we will know more about learning how to learn and how to generalize and evolve as we gain knowledge. The challenge of getting autonomous driving behavior to the next level presents too many data and processing issues for us to grapple with all of human intelligence. Humankind has yet to create a storage facility that can collect and hold all that data. But if computer scientists and industry researchers stay focused on AI agents for autonomous driving, we can overcome many of these challenges and we’ll begin seeing the first wave of fully autonomous vehicles that will offer higher levels of autonomous driving functions in the near future. All this new autonomous driving technology will be developed on back-end autonomous driving platforms that include compute, data lake, unified security, fully managed development security operations (DevSecOps), metadata management and governance, and a high-performance network. Any enhanced AI system will have to handle hundreds, if not thousands, of petabytes of data and at least thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs). The computer industry has begun to address many of these data storage and processing performance needs. We will continue to make bigger and faster computers but mastering the power of AI and applying it to autonomous driving will keep automotive computer science engineers busy for decades. It’s one of the great challenges of our generation. 6 All the AI approaches outlined in this paper are specific and focused on human driving behavior capabilities. While the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI) targets a different science and research area and technologists can apply it to multiple industries and business processes, the approaches outlined in this paper focus solely on driving an autonomous car.

Many offerings lack needed functionality. Organizations understand the reasons for moving to the cloud but struggle to develop a strategy and plan for success. Assistance from outside sources, such as DXC, is needed to help move clients forward. HR success requires more than a technology implementation. A good solution design will help clients realize long-term, sustainable value from their SAP SuccessFactors implementation through:  Assisting client with the development of a successful business case and a vision for HR for thoughtful change Designing and establishing new HR operating model including HR and payroll shared services and standardized processes Integrating successfully with other client systems Providing robust, experienced program execution and leadership Transferring knowledge so that the client can become self-sufficient Providing a robust data quality program and advice on data governance to ensure successful implementation program execution  October 17, 2019 ‹#› Why should SuccessFactors HCM be implemented? Only a detailed business case can show the specific benefits a client will gain from implementing SF Employee Central. However, many clients are experiencing significant gains from implementing a new core HR solution in the cloud. Key benefits may include:  These examples assume an implementation leverages the functionality that enables managers and employees to perform their own transactions (self service) eliminating the transactional burden from the HR department. 60% average reduction in time spent on HR processes helps clients focus on strategic initiatives and optimize their resources and business processes 25% to 50% lower HR operating expenses through improving workforce productivity by applying common leading industry practices and process standardization 52% of organizations saw a decrease in HR personnel cost with the move to the cloud given the increased automation and innovation 52% of organizations state that an increase in usage of employee self-service is linked to their cloud implementation 60% 50% 52% 52% October 17, 2019 ‹#› Offering overview Offering description Benefits Why choose DXC Technology? © 2018 DXC Technology Company.

Many offerings lack needed functionality. Organizations understand the reasons for moving to the cloud but struggle to develop a strategy and plan for success. Assistance from outside sources, such as DXC, is needed to help move clients forward. HR success requires more than a technology implementation. A good solution design will help clients realize long-term, sustainable value from their SAP SuccessFactors implementation through:  Assisting client with the development of a successful business case and a vision for HR for thoughtful change Designing and establishing new HR operating model including HR and payroll shared services and standardized processes Integrating successfully with other client systems Providing robust, experienced program execution and leadership Transferring knowledge so that the client can become self-sufficient Providing a robust data quality program and advice on data governance to ensure successful implementation program execution  October 17, 2019 ‹#› Why should SuccessFactors HCM be implemented? Only a detailed business case can show the specific benefits a client will gain from implementing SF Employee Central. However, many clients are experiencing significant gains from implementing a new core HR solution in the cloud. Key benefits may include:  These examples assume an implementation leverages the functionality that enables managers and employees to perform their own transactions (self service) eliminating the transactional burden from the HR department. 60% average reduction in time spent on HR processes helps clients focus on strategic initiatives and optimize their resources and business processes 25% to 50% lower HR operating expenses through improving workforce productivity by applying common leading industry practices and process standardization 52% of organizations saw a decrease in HR personnel cost with the move to the cloud given the increased automation and innovation 52% of organizations state that an increase in usage of employee self-service is linked to their cloud implementation 60% 50% 52% 52% October 17, 2019 ‹#› Offering overview Offering description Benefits Why choose DXC Technology? © 2018 DXC Technology Company.

This “one-size-fits-all” model – where the hardware, operating system, applications and profiles are hard-coupled and inflexible – does not serve the business needs of today which much take into account consumerization, mobility, the need for IT to lower costs and the necessity for IT to react quickly to ever-changing business needs. In a optimized, modern workplace the user, not the technology, becomes the focus. This approach requires a fundamentally different approach to enabling the user with the right information sources, devices, security, connectivity and support. One that takes into consideration the multiple business functions, multiple device types, and multiple personas in an organization. Already, information technology can easily enable your employees to be more mobile, to work with colleagues remotely across time zones, and to get work done in a variety of settings, inside and outside of the traditional office. Your support channels must also provide this flexibility and coverage. This transformation is being driven by changes in the market, different user behaviors and rapid technology changes. Today a user walks in with multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices, some his others provided by the enterprise. They work hours that would have been traditionally off-hours and they have delivery expectations set an application driven consumer experience. They are also much more comfortable with regular updates and changes and expect it. Beyond that the early adopters are already asking for analytics to better inform them of best practices and how to optimize and are much more likely to look-up how to fix something. Our employees are aware of how much is captured about them when they shop, browse and buy and they want that same type of intelligence applied in their work environment to speed their tasks. Information continues to be the lifeblood of organizations and is getting richer and more expansive and will only keep growing in terms of quantity and precision. Harnessing this through effective working environments will help your teams work faster, more seamlessly—whether their job is creating products, driving a globally diverse support team or selling – being able to instantly synchronize meetings, connect people, share content and find answers effectively whether in the office or away from it. The modern enterprise is more digital to accommodate a more diverse and mobile workforce. Organizations that harness this have the benefits shown on the right hand side of this slide. These stats come from external sources like Gallup, PWC and others. It is also what we have seen in our engagements with Fortune 500 companies around the world. This consistent view of the advantages of transforming to a modern enterprise that engaged employees, drive benefits including productivity, reduced absenteeism and this leads to happier clients that spend more with an organization, raising sales and profits is the reason many organizations are integrating a modern enterprise transformation into their business change agenda. The job of IT continues to be to provide the foundation: the tools and infrastructure needed to increase productivity and collaboration to maximize the efforts of tomorrow’s employees. It is also now the role of IT to help get the most from these tools, capabilities and new ways of working. What we give people to work on is the window into all IT – whether it is a new application, advanced analytics or instant-on cloud solution, people read/consume/decide on information and it has to be provided to them safely and efficiently. The new style of services in a modern enterprise can be described as productive, collaborative, connected and engaged. Delivering this is not a simple choice of on premise or cloud solutions. We have found that a hybrid solution brings the best to organizations and that this mix of services will be the leading model for the foreseeable future. So let me share our recipe for achieving a modern enterprise and explore where this transformation could lead your organization. Sources: “Work units in the top quartile in employee engagement outperformed bottom-quartile units by 10% on client ratings, 22% in profitability, and 21% in productivity. Work units in the top quartile also saw significantly lower turnover (25% in high-turnover organizations, 65% in low-turnover organizations), shrinkage (28%), and absenteeism (37%) and fewer safety incidents (48%), patient safety incidents (41%), and quality defects (41%).” Some additional insight from other analysts – PWC stats, showcase cross-over of millennials to workforce Key Messages: 1. becoming a modern enterprise is all about the user, the information they need to do their job and supporting technologies and help to make them effective 2. Engaged employees deliver better business results 3. The entire capability of IT is judged by employees based on their user environment experience…. the ability to put a modern enterprise in their hands whether at the office or on the go that allows them access to all important information sources is critical to a business’ change agenda and capacity to handle change. 5 Creating business value with VDA Collaborative Connected Secure Engaged Productive Me Enhance employee collaboration on virtual desktops with optimized Skype solutions Stay connected to partners by providing secure access to applications More productive employees with secure solutions for rich PCs and virtual desktops Increase employee engagement and satisfaction by allowing them to bring their own devices Increase security by getting data off endpoint devices Business value Faster time to market with follow-the-sun engineering and secure partner collaboration Accelerates mergers and acquisitions by making apps and desktops available in hours, not weeks Increased employee engagement and satisfaction by enabling BYOD Accelerates Windows 10 deployments enabling a consumer-like experience for employees October 15, 2019 ‹#› 6 Imperative for change – what do we hear from customers?

DXC can help you deliver your connected mobility environment for improved business advantage, employee productivity and helping you engage clients. For example: DXC has 780 mobile application developers who have created over 750 mobile applications for our clients in the last several years on all key platforms. These applications include use by 4 of the top 20 brands and are downloaded 1.2 million times per month. DXC teams manage 2.5 million mobile devices for our clients on a number of Mobile Device Management (MDM) platforms. DXC security teams are world-class and have discovered 10 X the number of security vulnerabilities for the industry in the last two years – MORE THAN ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS COMBINED. You want a security team with that depth of expertise working to help you secure your mobile environment and your infrastructure. In fact our security teams and application tools secure 1 million applications for DXC clients today. And we have 50,000 application specialists available to help you create the integrations you need to tie back to your corporate data systems. We spoke previously about the value of cloud for powering mobile client interactions…DXC Cloud capabilities power 8 of the 10 most trafficked websites in the world – 4 out of 5 of the world's largest search engines and the 3 of the most popular social media properties in the US. 28 DXC’s complete solution to speed implementation Internal Use Only    Identity Apps Devices Security Engaged Connected Productive Secure Persona  Personal Pricing and operations flexibility Support Services Mobile apps for employees Digital Communication and Collaboration Services Seamless integration User-driven, quick, non-intrusive migrations Partner ecosystem Network Services Identity and access Workplace management services Diagnostic and advisory workshops  Collaborative October 15, 2019 ‹#› A modern enterprise solution from DXC starts with a design approach that looks at the entire end to end requirements for employees to be productive and connected. The entire solution is user centered with four areas of concentration – connectivity, productivity, engagement and collaboration. These themes apply to the device, the identity we give to individuals and devices, the group of appropriate applications and a security design that is easy to use but gives greater control. We start with the segmentation and persona model described earlier. The ability to develop a clear view of the users, the current environment and how elements are designed today and how they will change is core. As mentioned, our diagnostic and advisory workshops concentrate on this area. Taking that as a starting point, we use our pre-configured and tested solutions for converged workplace services, identity and access management, digital collaboration and user support services to quickly provide a detailed design for an organization. The end to end solution also includes deep integration with partners to ensure that our clients not only get the best of key technologies from our partners, but have a trusted advisor that steers away from some claims of capability from technology companies that are not enterprise ready or may require more change than many organizations are willing to take. The DXC solutions have been designed to be migration friendly and allow for continuous integration and release – a normal in today’s cloud based solution world. One of the key benefits of a modern enterprise is the connectivity between users, departments and functions in an organization. Our click-to-connect approach to digital collaboration (messaging, Instant Messaging, desktop sharing, etc.) uses the best technology ecosystems of today from Microsoft and Google. We also implement unified communications to allow simple collaboration and presence insight to change from just email asynchronous modes of working to more synchronous, natural connections to work together across departments and sites. While many create and process applications are still desktop and laptop optimized, more and more users are working on phone/tablet/or purpose designed devices and our mobile applications capabilities, especially in the area of connecting to systems of record for accurate information will increase information access for these users. User support services are provided that meet the needs of any organization. Whether the phone, chat, email, self-support or walk-in. Giving users a simple to use, high quality service not only gets them back to being proactive quickly, it changes the way IT is viewed across the organization. Doing all of this requires a lot of engineering, testing, integration. Fortunately, we have done most of that in advance and it is presented to the purchasing/IT team with the ability to trade-off how we can deliver features and functionality and allows flexibility and tuning to meet the organization's needs. Our complete solution approach has been tuned through hundreds of engagements balancing configuration flexibility while avoiding time consuming trade-off analysis of multiple elements of a solution. Integrating the best technology from leading companies and innovative smaller companies brings innovation and stability to our solution. Key Messages: 1. Designing for the end to end solution is critical to a successful transformation to a modern enterprise 2. DXC has pre-integrated and optimized our solution to create a superior starting point that has common features for all industries and geographies 3.

DXC puts enough stock in this methodology to offer user performance oriented SLAs to ensure your users are satisfied with the performance of their new virtual desktop. The Discover phase uncovers “known” data or information. Through interviews and workshops we collect key information. The assess phase reveals “unknown” data and information. We do this by conducting desktop, app and existing VDA environment assessments. This gives us real data about what users are doing with the PCs, what apps are key and a high level look at application virtualization compatibility. This phase is critical to our success. DXC wants to deliver a service your users will love. Without the empirical data the assessments give us, the design and deploy phases are longer because lots of course and fine tuning is necessary to achieve the desired performance levels. The Design phase gets into the details to document the solution design. We’ll also design a pilot or user acceptance phase to ensure user feedback is good and performance and scalability is at required levels The Deploy phase is where we actually build out the infrastructure and identify which users are deployed when. DXC has best practices to maximize the virtualization ROI which can be applied to the rollout schedule The Manage phase is what you wanted from the beginning. You don’t need to worry about the system details, you can just monitor performance through the SLAs. Transformation roadmap   Current state Transformed steady-state operations Application compatibility assessment and remediation Detailed design and implementation Production pilot Enterprise-wide rollout Reference architecture sizing Image gold disk and applications software packaging Assess user, business, and application environment October 15, 2019 ‹#› This is a simplified view of the journey. DXC partners with our clients on so we can ensure we help provide the most successful transformation possible. It starts with assessing the user environment including applications so we know how to size the virtualization infrastructure. Next we examine the applications to determine their suitability for virtualization and suggest remediation steps for those apps that don’t score well on the compatibility scale. Using the data discovered in the previous two activities we can size the virtualization infrastructure as well as ensure each user obtains the most cost effective and best compute model for their unique needs. Once sized and each user aligned to a compute profile, we can embark on packaging applications and developing gold disk images. Next in line is the detailed design and installation of the infrastructure. Now you’re ready to test. The production/pilot phase lets users “kick the tires” on the new system and provide feedback for the final rollout phase. A great deal goes in to figuring out which users, locations and organizations should roll out in what order. DXC can also provide user oriented change management services to aid you in user communications during this time And, voila, you’re transformed.

This “one-size-fits-all” model – where the hardware, operating system, applications and profiles are hard-coupled and inflexible – does not serve the business needs of today which much take into account consumerization, mobility, the need for IT to lower costs and the necessity for IT to react quickly to ever-changing business needs. In a optimized, modern workplace the user, not the technology, becomes the focus. This approach requires a fundamentally different approach to enabling the user with the right information sources, devices, security, connectivity and support. One that takes into consideration the multiple business functions, multiple device types, and multiple personas in an organization. Already, information technology can easily enable your employees to be more mobile, to work with colleagues remotely across time zones, and to get work done in a variety of settings, inside and outside of the traditional office. Your support channels must also provide this flexibility and coverage. This transformation is being driven by changes in the market, different user behaviors and rapid technology changes. Today a user walks in with multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices, some his others provided by the enterprise. They work hours that would have been traditionally off-hours and they have delivery expectations set an application driven consumer experience. They are also much more comfortable with regular updates and changes and expect it. Beyond that the early adopters are already asking for analytics to better inform them of best practices and how to optimize and are much more likely to look-up how to fix something. Our employees are aware of how much is captured about them when they shop, browse and buy and they want that same type of intelligence applied in their work environment to speed their tasks. Information continues to be the lifeblood of organizations and is getting richer and more expansive and will only keep growing in terms of quantity and precision. Harnessing this through effective working environments will help your teams work faster, more seamlessly—whether their job is creating products, driving a globally diverse support team or selling – being able to instantly synchronize meetings, connect people, share content and find answers effectively whether in the office or away from it. The modern enterprise is more digital to accommodate a more diverse and mobile workforce. Organizations that harness this have the benefits shown on the right hand side of this slide. These stats come from external sources like Gallup, PWC and others. It is also what we have seen in our engagements with Fortune 500 companies around the world. This consistent view of the advantages of transforming to a modern enterprise that engaged employees, drive benefits including productivity, reduced absenteeism and this leads to happier clients that spend more with an organization, raising sales and profits is the reason many organizations are integrating a modern enterprise transformation into their business change agenda. The job of IT continues to be to provide the foundation: the tools and infrastructure needed to increase productivity and collaboration to maximize the efforts of tomorrow’s employees. It is also now the role of IT to help get the most from these tools, capabilities and new ways of working. What we give people to work on is the window into all IT – whether it is a new application, advanced analytics or instant-on cloud solution, people read/consume/decide on information and it has to be provided to them safely and efficiently. The new style of services in a modern enterprise can be described as productive, collaborative, connected and engaged. Delivering this is not a simple choice of on premise or cloud solutions. We have found that a hybrid solution brings the best to organizations and that this mix of services will be the leading model for the foreseeable future. So let me share our recipe for achieving a modern enterprise and explore where this transformation could lead your organization. Sources: “Work units in the top quartile in employee engagement outperformed bottom-quartile units by 10% on client ratings, 22% in profitability, and 21% in productivity. Work units in the top quartile also saw significantly lower turnover (25% in high-turnover organizations, 65% in low-turnover organizations), shrinkage (28%), and absenteeism (37%) and fewer safety incidents (48%), patient safety incidents (41%), and quality defects (41%).” Some additional insight from other analysts – PWC stats, showcase cross-over of millennials to workforce Key Messages: 1. becoming a modern enterprise is all about the user, the information they need to do their job and supporting technologies and help to make them effective 2. Engaged employees deliver better business results 3. The entire capability of IT is judged by employees based on their user environment experience…. the ability to put a modern enterprise in their hands whether at the office or on the go that allows them access to all important information sources is critical to a business’ change agenda and capacity to handle change. 5 Creating business value with VDA Collaborative Connected Secure Engaged Productive Me Enhance employee collaboration on virtual desktops with optimized Skype solutions Stay connected to partners by providing secure access to applications More productive employees with secure solutions for rich PCs and virtual desktops Increase employee engagement and satisfaction by allowing them to bring their own devices Increase security by getting data off endpoint devices Business value Faster time to market with follow-the-sun engineering and secure partner collaboration Accelerates mergers and acquisitions by making apps and desktops available in hours, not weeks Increased employee engagement and satisfaction by enabling BYOD Accelerates Windows 10 deployments enabling a consumer-like experience for employees October 15, 2019 ‹#› 6 Imperative for change – what do we hear from customers?

DXC can help you deliver your connected mobility environment for improved business advantage, employee productivity and helping you engage clients. For example: DXC has 780 mobile application developers who have created over 750 mobile applications for our clients in the last several years on all key platforms. These applications include use by 4 of the top 20 brands and are downloaded 1.2 million times per month. DXC teams manage 2.5 million mobile devices for our clients on a number of Mobile Device Management (MDM) platforms. DXC security teams are world-class and have discovered 10 X the number of security vulnerabilities for the industry in the last two years – MORE THAN ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS COMBINED. You want a security team with that depth of expertise working to help you secure your mobile environment and your infrastructure. In fact our security teams and application tools secure 1 million applications for DXC clients today. And we have 50,000 application specialists available to help you create the integrations you need to tie back to your corporate data systems. We spoke previously about the value of cloud for powering mobile client interactions…DXC Cloud capabilities power 8 of the 10 most trafficked websites in the world – 4 out of 5 of the world's largest search engines and the 3 of the most popular social media properties in the US. 28 DXC’s complete solution to speed implementation Internal Use Only    Identity Apps Devices Security Engaged Connected Productive Secure Persona  Personal Pricing and operations flexibility Support Services Mobile apps for employees Digital Communication and Collaboration Services Seamless integration User-driven, quick, non-intrusive migrations Partner ecosystem Network Services Identity and access Workplace management services Diagnostic and advisory workshops  Collaborative October 15, 2019 ‹#› A modern enterprise solution from DXC starts with a design approach that looks at the entire end to end requirements for employees to be productive and connected. The entire solution is user centered with four areas of concentration – connectivity, productivity, engagement and collaboration. These themes apply to the device, the identity we give to individuals and devices, the group of appropriate applications and a security design that is easy to use but gives greater control. We start with the segmentation and persona model described earlier. The ability to develop a clear view of the users, the current environment and how elements are designed today and how they will change is core. As mentioned, our diagnostic and advisory workshops concentrate on this area. Taking that as a starting point, we use our pre-configured and tested solutions for converged workplace services, identity and access management, digital collaboration and user support services to quickly provide a detailed design for an organization. The end to end solution also includes deep integration with partners to ensure that our clients not only get the best of key technologies from our partners, but have a trusted advisor that steers away from some claims of capability from technology companies that are not enterprise ready or may require more change than many organizations are willing to take. The DXC solutions have been designed to be migration friendly and allow for continuous integration and release – a normal in today’s cloud based solution world. One of the key benefits of a modern enterprise is the connectivity between users, departments and functions in an organization. Our click-to-connect approach to digital collaboration (messaging, Instant Messaging, desktop sharing, etc.) uses the best technology ecosystems of today from Microsoft and Google. We also implement unified communications to allow simple collaboration and presence insight to change from just email asynchronous modes of working to more synchronous, natural connections to work together across departments and sites. While many create and process applications are still desktop and laptop optimized, more and more users are working on phone/tablet/or purpose designed devices and our mobile applications capabilities, especially in the area of connecting to systems of record for accurate information will increase information access for these users. User support services are provided that meet the needs of any organization. Whether the phone, chat, email, self-support or walk-in. Giving users a simple to use, high quality service not only gets them back to being proactive quickly, it changes the way IT is viewed across the organization. Doing all of this requires a lot of engineering, testing, integration. Fortunately, we have done most of that in advance and it is presented to the purchasing/IT team with the ability to trade-off how we can deliver features and functionality and allows flexibility and tuning to meet the organization's needs. Our complete solution approach has been tuned through hundreds of engagements balancing configuration flexibility while avoiding time consuming trade-off analysis of multiple elements of a solution. Integrating the best technology from leading companies and innovative smaller companies brings innovation and stability to our solution. Key Messages: 1. Designing for the end to end solution is critical to a successful transformation to a modern enterprise 2. DXC has pre-integrated and optimized our solution to create a superior starting point that has common features for all industries and geographies 3.

DXC puts enough stock in this methodology to offer user performance oriented SLAs to ensure your users are satisfied with the performance of their new virtual desktop. The Discover phase uncovers “known” data or information. Through interviews and workshops we collect key information. The assess phase reveals “unknown” data and information. We do this by conducting desktop, app and existing VDA environment assessments. This gives us real data about what users are doing with the PCs, what apps are key and a high level look at application virtualization compatibility. This phase is critical to our success. DXC wants to deliver a service your users will love. Without the empirical data the assessments give us, the design and deploy phases are longer because lots of course and fine tuning is necessary to achieve the desired performance levels. The Design phase gets into the details to document the solution design. We’ll also design a pilot or user acceptance phase to ensure user feedback is good and performance and scalability is at required levels The Deploy phase is where we actually build out the infrastructure and identify which users are deployed when. DXC has best practices to maximize the virtualization ROI which can be applied to the rollout schedule The Manage phase is what you wanted from the beginning. You don’t need to worry about the system details, you can just monitor performance through the SLAs. Transformation roadmap   Current state Transformed steady-state operations Application compatibility assessment and remediation Detailed design and implementation Production pilot Enterprise-wide rollout Reference architecture sizing Image gold disk and applications software packaging Assess user, business, and application environment October 15, 2019 ‹#› This is a simplified view of the journey. DXC partners with our clients on so we can ensure we help provide the most successful transformation possible. It starts with assessing the user environment including applications so we know how to size the virtualization infrastructure. Next we examine the applications to determine their suitability for virtualization and suggest remediation steps for those apps that don’t score well on the compatibility scale. Using the data discovered in the previous two activities we can size the virtualization infrastructure as well as ensure each user obtains the most cost effective and best compute model for their unique needs. Once sized and each user aligned to a compute profile, we can embark on packaging applications and developing gold disk images. Next in line is the detailed design and installation of the infrastructure. Now you’re ready to test. The production/pilot phase lets users “kick the tires” on the new system and provide feedback for the final rollout phase. A great deal goes in to figuring out which users, locations and organizations should roll out in what order. DXC can also provide user oriented change management services to aid you in user communications during this time And, voila, you’re transformed.

Any business listed in the New York Stock Exchange is required to comply with the SOX accounting standards. This act applies to all U.S. and foreign companies that trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange. SOX protects stakeholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices. To improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures for publicly traded companies, companies are required to comply with SOX and must include any service provider that provides services that could impact their financial controls. The majority of DXC customers contractually require DXC to conduct a Service and Organization Control (SOC) 1 audit, which is the preferred approach by DXC. To meet the contractual and otherwise needed method to comply with a customer’s SOX requirements, DXC offers TPA SOC Reporting Services. [bookmark: _Toc21953513]Customer Benefits TPA SOC Reports enable customers to comply with SOX requirements for DXC as one of their service providers. Service demonstrates to customers that DXC has effective controls and processes in place thereby building confidence with the customer. Customer achieves cost savings through shared DXC SOC reporting to meet their SOX requirements. Global service resource availability helps manage many geographic locations to meet customer needs in a timely manner. Customer benefits from best practices employed by DXC’s Big 4 audit partner firm and from a DXC team that manages hundreds of such reports annually for more than a decade.Audits are performed by an independent auditing firm which allow DXC to have control policies and procedures evaluated and tested on an annual or semi-annual basis. The reports demonstrate to customers that DXC has effective controls and processes in place by providing information regarding the service organization's controls and the effectiveness of those controls. DXC reports are considered “dual opinion” reports because the auditor's opinion takes into consideration both the ISAE3402 and SSAE18 standards. DXC has engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”), a multinational professional services company, as its independent auditing firm to conduct Third Party Assurance (TPA) SOC Reporting for DXC Managed Services for DXC customers. All SOC Audits will be performed by Deloitte. Note: Customer may not select their own audit firm.

There is no dedicated or on-customer-site staffing required for TPA SOC Reporting. [bookmark: _Toc21953517]Tools DXC Policies and Standards Enterprise Security Information System (ESIS) is the current DXC delivery repository for Global Risk and Compliance (GRC) which houses DXC information security controls and procedures used to provide or support Global Delivery Organization (GDO) services, including DXC internal infrastructure as well as those systems used to support customer facing services. The use of ESIS is mandated for all DXC delivery functions to ensure that they are delivering to DXC and customer information security requirements. Please note, ESIS should be added to all TPA SOC Reporting deals. The functions of the ESIS GRC includes the following: Policy Management Enterprise Management Compliance Management Issue Management Risk Management Threat Management Benefits provided by ESIS: Houses DXC Policy framework including SOC standards to utilize for DXC customers and to which is aligned with DXC Corporate Policies and Standards (i.e., Policy Tech) Provides a secure, centralized repository to track audit findings, exceptions to policy, risk acceptances, and remediation plans and evidence to show remediation completed More information can be found on the ESIS landing page or you may contact mailto:polgov@dxc.com. Technology Compliance Management [bookmark: _Toc499646079]The DXC Technology Compliance (TCM) service (sold separately) provides compliance reporting for DXC customers and includes a tool component to provide that reporting. DXC TCM is required for any customer obtaining a DXC TPA SOC Report (SOC 1 Type I and II or SOC 2 Type I and II) for TPA SOC in-scope servers regardless of whether the TPA SOC Report is a dedicated SOC report or leveraged SOC report. This also applies to traditional ITO and cloud. This is because the TCM service provides data necessary to show compliance to DXC standards that may be tested in SOC reporting. TCM does not apply when: TPA SOC Report is a ‘Base’ Site only report (SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports). It is written into the contract that customer is managing their own environment. For future consideration, Azure, AWS, Google Cloud are/will be implemented in Customer compartments: Currently, the TCM cost model does not afford a suitable cost for Cloud. Symantec CCS software cannot handle images being constantly spun up and down, so another solution is warrented. A version of Symantec Cloud Workload Assurance (CWA) will be out in late 2019, which is planned to be evaluated, along with others, for Azure, AWS and Google Cloud, so stay tuned for a decision on compliance reporting for Azure, AWS, Google. DXC reports will only include the services provided by DXC. Azure, AWS and Google Cloud will not be included in the scope of DXC TPA SOC reports. [bookmark: _Toc499646080][bookmark: _Toc21953518]Develop Customer Solution Strategy DXC TPA SOC is designed for customers looking for visibility and control of the systems and processes managed by DXC for their business. TPA SOC Reporting services provide assurance to DXC customers and their customers and service users, concerning the controls for DXC managed systems and processes. DXC achieves this via Third Party Assurance reports. The reports provide an independent, objective report on the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls at a service organization. The reports provide a uniform reporting formats for organizations to disclose their control activities and processes to their customer. DXC has a comprehensive program of SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II Assurance Reports. SOC 1 or SOC 2 audits for DXC Technology are performed by Deloitte & Touche audit firm, in conjunction with DXC’s TPA SOC Team. This approach allows DXC to have control policies and procedures evaluated and tested on an annual or semi-annual basis. The reports demonstrate to customers that DXC has effective controls and processes in place. DXC reports are considered “dual opinion” reports because the auditor's opinion takes into consideration both the ISAE3402 and SSAE18 standards. [bookmark: _Toc21953519]Report Contents Reports include several standard sections as follows: Section 1 - A Management Assertion stating that DXC fairly representing the system /processes throughout the review period, DXC asserts that the control objectives are suitably designed to achieve the control objectives. and the criteria by which DXC can make the assertion. Section 2 - An auditor's opinion that covers that the description of the controls is presented fairly, the controls are designed effectively and the controls operate as intended over a specified period of time Section 3 – The Description of Services includes the services provide to the customer, relevant control objectives, entity level control components, key system elements, key complementary user–entity controls and subservice organizations Section 4 - Control objectives, controls needed to meet the objective, service auditor testing and results of tests. Testing will include both the design and operating effectiveness of the control environment.

The most important component to consider when qualifying a deal is the SOC Report(s) needed, which drives the level of effort and correlative costs for TPA SOC Reporting services. Service costs and pricing are based on: Which SOC Report(s) are in scope Security policies and control standards based on DXC or customer policies Logical Access required or not Site Locations being base or non-base Type and number of customer specific controls Type I – a Type I is a report on policies and procedures placed in operation as of a specified point in time. ISAE 3402/SSAE 18/SSAE 18 Type I reports evaluate the design effectiveness of a service provider’s controls and then confirms that the controls have been placed in operation as of a specific date. Type I reports are quite limited in their usability. SOC 1 Type I reports do not suffice for Sarbanes-Oxley Act purposes. Type II – a Type II is a report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for a period of time (usually 6 or 12 months). ISAE 3402/SSAE 18 SOC 1 Type II reports include the examination and confirmation steps involved in a Type I examination include an evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the controls for a period of at least six consecutive calendar months. Most user organizations require their service provider to undergo the Type II level examination for the greater level of assurance it provides. SOC reports that fall under “customer specific or customer leveraged should not start until 6 months post contract signing. Why SOC 1 Type ll Reports are Useful There are two primary reasons SOC 1 Type II reports are useful. First, SOC 1 is accepted for use by customers in their reporting of controls over financial reporting. Reporting on internal controls over financial reporting were brought into focus by regulatory actions such as the United States’ Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act dictates what publicly traded companies must do to assert to the effectiveness of controls over their financial reporting. Such assertions are used as input to what the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) calls the 10-K report found in publicly traded companies’ Annual Reports. SOX applies to any company that trades on the US Stock Exchange. SOC 1 reports will be prepared in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 and with International Standards for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) No. 3402. Secondly, rather than have hundreds of customers and their auditors coming into a Service Organization (DXC in this instance) to conduct audits, these reports can be delivered to any in-scope Customer as a substitute for the Customer conducting its own audit. So, based upon the Customer’s needs and applicability of the report(s), the delivery organization can alleviate demands for what could be redundant testing/auditing.

Verify with the customer if they want a copy of the SOC 1 because there are charges associated with it. by Delivery Center. Some sites may be grouped together to save on costs. For SOC 1 Base Reports, a standard quoting mechanism may be used to calculate these costs for the opportunity. See ‘Configurator’ section in this guide for further details on the standard quoting mechanism. Unless another report is explicitly requested by the customer, the shared SOC 1 is what is typically provided . Verify with the customer that they need a copy of the SOC 1 because there are charges associated with it. SOC 2 Reports A SOC 2 is a report on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy. A SOC 2 cannot be used to replace a SOC 1 based on AICPA guidelines A SOC 2 should not be used for financial reporting such as SOX. SOC 2 is used by customers to ensure security practices are followed based on the contract In other words, for auditing purposes not specifically focused on satisfying internal controls over financial reporting, SOC 2 reports could be required. These reports will focus on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and/or privacy. SOC 2 may or may not be requested along with a SOC 1. SOC 1 is focused on controls relevant to financial reporting. SOC 2 is focused on security controls. SOC 2 reports that are shared and focus on a Delivery Center focus on the the Security Principle. The Virtual Private Cloud SOC 2 covers Secruity and Availability. If the customer requires other principle the report will be noted as a customer specific and costs fall outside of the shared environment pricing. Customer Leveraged Reports Customer Leveraged Reports include Base plus Logical Access Testing. For Logical Access Testing: Cost is not based on number of servers. Sample sizes for server testing is normally between 1-25 depending on total number of servers in scope. Cost is based on number of platforms in scope. The Customer will receive a report with the relevant site information and operating system/database logical access for their operating platforms only. The table below lists the standard operating systems typically included in scope: HPUX Mainframe Stratus VOS IBMi HP Non Stop Tru64 IBM AIX Open VMS VMWare Linux Oracle Solaris Windows Oracle database SQL database DB2  Be mindful and consider the following with regard to platform types (Operating Systems and uses of servers). You may have an opportunity to trim these from what you are considering as you quote the costs for report production. These can have an impact on actual cost as well as reporting results. Servers to include: Servers must be in production “supported” status to be included in the inventory SOX servers only that are used for the customer’s financial reporting Servers that have been verified for compliance Given there is a high risk of deviations and the fact that they are not normally considered important for financial reporting, exclude these types of servers/databases: Platforms with Customer administrative rights or elevated privileges Platforms that do not have Customer data Platforms NOT managed by DXC or are managed by the customer or a third party or using customer dedicated tools. Platforms that are decommissioned at any time during the review period (retain change tickets) Test, model office, development, transitioning, file, DXC tools management servers, print and mail servers The reason for server exclusions: Increased risk of qualified objectives (negative) in the reports Increased risk of delays to the audit schedule, which could delay the final report Increased costs to the account/Customer Improper scoping NOTE: If the customer requires that you include any of the above type servers, then please set up a one-on-one meeting with the TPA Program team to discuss possible options. Other items to consider: If servers not managed to DXC standards, then customer’s policies/standards documents must be providedThe standards must be updated annually DXC is contractually required to follow customer standards and the standards are not available then DXC standards are used by default Customer-dedicated tools and processes may only in scope if managed by DXC. Customer must not be able to change DXC managed activities. Application level controls are considered customer specific and will require a separate quote Customer Specific Reports Customer Specific Reports vary widely based the control objectives the customer wants in scope. The costs vary widely based on the scope. Smallest cost is $12k and up to $1M. Customers request our service because it can save them money and cost and also provides a third party opinion. To request quoting for Customer Specific SOC 1 Controls reporting, SOC 2 reporting, please go to this link, read the instructions Tab first. Next, click on the Scoping Questionnaire Tab and fill out the appropriate questionnaire sections. Submit the completed questionnaire by emailing it to ISAE3402@dxc.com which will send it to the TPA SOC Reporting team. Answer the questions in the appropriate questionnaire as best you can with the knowledge you currently have of the customer and the solution strategy to be proposed. Once you have submitted the questionnaire, it is a good measure to alert the TPA SOC Reporting team. They will review your request and get back with you regarding any missing information or if they need clarifications.

NOTES: Additional guidance from Legal AUDIT Contracting Rules: If customer has Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)/financial controls audit requirements: DXC’s preference is to provide customer an ISAE 3402/SSAE 18 System and Service Organization Control 1 (SOC 1), Type 2, report, released annually, that includes DXC’s financially relevant standard IT processes and DXC-defined controls that align to the AICPA’s SOC 1 audit guidance. Customer can be included within scope once their processes have been fully transitioned and managed by DXC for a minimum of 6 months. The cost of the required standard SOC 1 report(s) should be added to the cost model and charges. If customer is not using DXC standard practices, requires a customer specific SOC 1 report, or has specific SOX 404 and/or security requirements, the requirements need to be assessed during the bid process and tailored accordingly. The costs (both internal and external) of any customer-specific reports should be passed through to customer, or added to the cost model and charges.

This team can confirm what, if any reporting, this customer is currently receiving (which sites, which Operating Systems, current costs, etc.). Standard and leveraged SOC 1 reporting is typically delivered to accounts in the October or November time-frame, so costs within your CMT should align accordingly. Timeframe will be dictated by the customers fiscal year end. Does your customer require logical access to be included in the ISAE3402 SOC 1 report? If NO, then… The Site or Central IT report can be used to satisfy the customer’s requirements, if needed. Accounts may still want to ensure data backup servers and firewalls are provided in the inventory templates in order for them to appear in the Site Reports.

SSAE 16/SSAE 18 and ISAE 3402 are the result of a collaborative effort put forth by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), a standard-setting board of the International Federation of Accountants and the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Both entities closely aligned each of their respective standards in an attempt to follow a growing move towards more international, globally accepted accounting standards. SOC Reports A SOC 1 Report (System and Organization Controls Report) is a report on Controls at a Service Organization which are relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting. SOC 2 Report is intended to meet the needs of a broad range of users that need to understand internal control at a service organization as it relates to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy. These reports are performed using the AICPA Guide: Reporting on Controls at a Service Organizations Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy and are intended for use by stakeholders (e.g., customers, regulators, business partners, suppliers, directors) of the service organization that have a thorough understanding of the service organization and its internal controls. These reports assist with the following: Oversight of the organization Vendor management program Internal corporate governance and risk management processes Regulatory oversight While the SOC 1 report is mainly concerned with examining controls over financial reporting, the SOC 2 reports focus more on the pre-defined, standardized benchmarks for controls related to security, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of the Delivery Center’s system and information. SOC 2 examines the details of Delivery Center testing and operational effectiveness Essentially, these SOC reports reflect the controls described (provided) by the service organization (i.e., DXC), the tests of those controls as performed by the service auditor, the results of those tests, the service organization’s assertion of the operating effectiveness of those controls, and the service auditor’s opinion on the operating effectiveness of the tested controls. These are independent, objective reports on the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls at a service organization. The reports provide a uniform reporting format for organizations to disclose their control activities and processes to their customer(s). Examination Report on Controls (ER) Less common report, now called [Examination Report on Controls] previously referred to as Custom Criteria Reports (CCR) reports Controls at a Service Organization based on specific criteria, but does not require a control environment to be reviewed. It is a limited scope engagement with an auditor's opinion. Provides an auditor's opinion specific to the controls tested.

If an ER report is required by Customer XXX, please contact the TPA program lead for pricing and timing (reports delivery). ​Agreed Upon Procedures (AUP) Less common report, Report on System and Controls at a Service Organization based on agreed upon procedures between the user entity, their external financial auditor, DXC and DXC's auditing firm. Primarily used to ensure remediation has been completed as stated in the SOC 1 or SOC 2 report. These reports do not offer an auditor's opinion. Point in Time audit with only the results of testing being provided to the customer/user entity (No Auditor Opinion provided). Access letter and sign off on the procedures is required. Add language below: AUP Reports. If an AUP report is required by Customer XXX, please contact the TPA program lead for pricing and timing (reports delivery). Auditor’s Opinion Below are standard SOC reporting terms for general awareness. Solutioners should not need to refer to these terms as part of the Solutioning phase. DXC Technology are considered ""dual"" opinion reports. The auditor's opinion will take into consideration both the ISAE3402 and the SSAE18 standard. The standards are very similar and will be accepted by the DXC customer. The auditor's opinion can be found in Section 1I of the report. The opinion explains the scope of the audit and the auditor's opinion in regards to the controls in place. There are two types of opinion, unqualified and qualified. Unqualified - The auditor will state that DXC Technology meets the objectives listed in the report during the review period. There could be deviations noted but based on the overall tests DXC meets the control objectives. Qualified – The auditor will state that DXC did not meet one or more control objectives. Based on the testing that was completed the auditor has found sufficient reason to state that the objectives was not met. A qualified opinion is a negative result that could cause your Customer to be concerned. Please note that a qualified opinon states that an objective was not met. The auditor is stating that all objecives were met as stated in the report but the auditor will will qualify their opinion by stating that objective x was not met for this reason xxxx Types of Quaifications Scope Limitation - A scope limitation is a qualification but it is due to the auditor not being able to offer an opinion on a specific area that was not in place during the full review period. Scope limitations are not normally a concern but keep your customer informed of any scope limitation to ensure it is not considered a negative result. Operating Effectiveness – During testing the auditor found that the process in place was not met. The deviaton(s), also known as an excepton is severe enough that it poses a risk to the customer. Cutomers will expect an immediate correction or a plan to correct the deviations.Design – This is the most serious type of qualification. The auditor is stating that based on a lack of process or the fact that the process does not meet industry standards , DXC cannot meet the control objective as stated.

Any business listed in the New York Stock Exchange is required to comply with the SOX accounting standards. This act applies to all U.S. and foreign companies that trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange. SOX protects stakeholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices. To improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures for publicly traded companies, companies are required to comply with SOX and must include any service provider that provides services that could impact their financial controls. The majority of DXC customers contractually require DXC to conduct a Service and Organization Control (SOC) 1 audit, which is the preferred approach by DXC. To meet the contractual and otherwise needed method to comply with a customer’s SOX requirements, DXC offers TPA SOC Reporting Services. [bookmark: _Toc21953513]Customer Benefits TPA SOC Reports enable customers to comply with SOX requirements for DXC as one of their service providers. Service demonstrates to customers that DXC has effective controls and processes in place thereby building confidence with the customer. Customer achieves cost savings through shared DXC SOC reporting to meet their SOX requirements. Global service resource availability helps manage many geographic locations to meet customer needs in a timely manner. Customer benefits from best practices employed by DXC’s Big 4 audit partner firm and from a DXC team that manages hundreds of such reports annually for more than a decade.Audits are performed by an independent auditing firm which allow DXC to have control policies and procedures evaluated and tested on an annual or semi-annual basis. The reports demonstrate to customers that DXC has effective controls and processes in place by providing information regarding the service organization's controls and the effectiveness of those controls. DXC reports are considered “dual opinion” reports because the auditor's opinion takes into consideration both the ISAE3402 and SSAE18 standards. DXC has engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”), a multinational professional services company, as its independent auditing firm to conduct Third Party Assurance (TPA) SOC Reporting for DXC Managed Services for DXC customers. All SOC Audits will be performed by Deloitte. Note: Customer may not select their own audit firm.

SOC 1 Reports on systems and controls at a service organization relevant to user entities’ internal control over financial reporting Must include the full customer’s environment Provides an auditor’s opinion on the design and operating effectiveness of the environment being audited SOC 2 Reports on system and controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy Must include the full customer’s environment related to one or more of the principles Provides an auditor’s opinion on the design and operating effectiveness of the environment being audited Reports on internal controls related to compliance or operations and can be used to assess against common industry frameworks Type I and Type II The SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports can either be a Type I and Type II, however, TPA SOC Report requests are commonly Type II: Type I - reports on management's description of a service organization's system and the suitability of the design of controls Type II - reports on management's description of a service organization's system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls See Section 11.1 SOC Fundamentals in this guide for further information. Base Package The following SOC reports are available in the Base Package. Each base package is associated with a DXC Shared Environment. DXC Shared Environments include Delivery Centers (DCs), Central IT and/or Cloud Infrastructure. For DCs the Base Package is aligned to a specified list of DXC sites. Note: Not all DCs are included as part of Base costing. See the TPA SOC Base sites on the TPA SOC SharePoint. Delivery Center Reports SOC 1 Type II report that covers physical security, incident management, change management, network access and data backup control objectives based on DXC Policies and Standards. SOC 2 Type II report that includes the Security Trust Services Principle (TSP) based on DXC Policies and Standards. Cloud Reports SOC 1 Type II report for VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Infrastructure that covers physical security, incident management, change management, network access and data backup control objectives based on DXC Policies and Standards. SOC 2 Type II report for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Infrastructure that covers Trust Services Principles (TSP) for Security, Availability and Confidentiality based on DXC Policies and Standards. SOC 1 Type II report for Cloud Business Unit (CBU) Infrastructure that covers physical security, incident management, change management, network access and data backup control objectives based on DXC Policies and Standards.

Note: Customer Policies and Standards maybe used for logical access testing based on the contract. If Customer Policies and Standards are contractual they must be updated annually. If the customer standard is silent, DXC standards will be used for testing purposes. Customer Specific Reports There are seven (7) Customer Specific reports. In some instances, the report includes a Base package plus logical access testing and/or other customer specific controls (which may be based on DXC or Customer policies and standards). In some cases, the customer may require customer specific reports that do not include a Base package. The following seven (7) Customer Specific reports are available: Delivery Center SOC 1 Type II Report for a Delivery Center included in Base Package plus testing for other services DXC provides such as logical access to servers, databases and/or applications as well as other areas that DXC manages on behalf of the customer Delivery Center SOC 1 Type II Report for a Delivery Center that is not available in the Base Package, (.

There is no dedicated or on-customer-site staffing required for TPA SOC Reporting. [bookmark: _Toc21953517]Tools DXC Policies and Standards Enterprise Security Information System (ESIS) is the current DXC delivery repository for Global Risk and Compliance (GRC) which houses DXC information security controls and procedures used to provide or support Global Delivery Organization (GDO) services, including DXC internal infrastructure as well as those systems used to support customer facing services. The use of ESIS is mandated for all DXC delivery functions to ensure that they are delivering to DXC and customer information security requirements. Please note, ESIS should be added to all TPA SOC Reporting deals. The functions of the ESIS GRC includes the following: Policy Management Enterprise Management Compliance Management Issue Management Risk Management Threat Management Benefits provided by ESIS: Houses DXC Policy framework including SOC standards to utilize for DXC customers and to which is aligned with DXC Corporate Policies and Standards (i.e., Policy Tech) Provides a secure, centralized repository to track audit findings, exceptions to policy, risk acceptances, and remediation plans and evidence to show remediation completed More information can be found on the ESIS landing page or you may contact mailto:polgov@dxc.com. Technology Compliance Management [bookmark: _Toc499646079]The DXC Technology Compliance (TCM) service (sold separately) provides compliance reporting for DXC customers and includes a tool component to provide that reporting. DXC TCM is required for any customer obtaining a DXC TPA SOC Report (SOC 1 Type I and II or SOC 2 Type I and II) for TPA SOC in-scope servers regardless of whether the TPA SOC Report is a dedicated SOC report or leveraged SOC report. This also applies to traditional ITO and cloud. This is because the TCM service provides data necessary to show compliance to DXC standards that may be tested in SOC reporting. TCM does not apply when: TPA SOC Report is a ‘Base’ Site only report (SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports). It is written into the contract that customer is managing their own environment. For future consideration, Azure, AWS, Google Cloud are/will be implemented in Customer compartments: Currently, the TCM cost model does not afford a suitable cost for Cloud. Symantec CCS software cannot handle images being constantly spun up and down, so another solution is warrented. A version of Symantec Cloud Workload Assurance (CWA) will be out in late 2019, which is planned to be evaluated, along with others, for Azure, AWS and Google Cloud, so stay tuned for a decision on compliance reporting for Azure, AWS, Google. DXC reports will only include the services provided by DXC. Azure, AWS and Google Cloud will not be included in the scope of DXC TPA SOC reports. [bookmark: _Toc499646080][bookmark: _Toc21953518]Develop Customer Solution Strategy DXC TPA SOC is designed for customers looking for visibility and control of the systems and processes managed by DXC for their business. TPA SOC Reporting services provide assurance to DXC customers and their customers and service users, concerning the controls for DXC managed systems and processes. DXC achieves this via Third Party Assurance reports. The reports provide an independent, objective report on the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls at a service organization. The reports provide a uniform reporting formats for organizations to disclose their control activities and processes to their customer. DXC has a comprehensive program of SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II Assurance Reports. SOC 1 or SOC 2 audits for DXC Technology are performed by Deloitte & Touche audit firm, in conjunction with DXC’s TPA SOC Team. This approach allows DXC to have control policies and procedures evaluated and tested on an annual or semi-annual basis. The reports demonstrate to customers that DXC has effective controls and processes in place. DXC reports are considered “dual opinion” reports because the auditor's opinion takes into consideration both the ISAE3402 and SSAE18 standards. [bookmark: _Toc21953519]Report Contents Reports include several standard sections as follows: Section 1 - A Management Assertion stating that DXC fairly representing the system /processes throughout the review period, DXC asserts that the control objectives are suitably designed to achieve the control objectives. and the criteria by which DXC can make the assertion. Section 2 - An auditor's opinion that covers that the description of the controls is presented fairly, the controls are designed effectively and the controls operate as intended over a specified period of time Section 3 – The Description of Services includes the services provide to the customer, relevant control objectives, entity level control components, key system elements, key complementary user–entity controls and subservice organizations Section 4 - Control objectives, controls needed to meet the objective, service auditor testing and results of tests. Testing will include both the design and operating effectiveness of the control environment.

The most important component to consider when qualifying a deal is the SOC Report(s) needed, which drives the level of effort and correlative costs for TPA SOC Reporting services. Service costs and pricing are based on: Which SOC Report(s) are in scope Security policies and control standards based on DXC or customer policies Logical Access required or not Site Locations being base or non-base Type and number of customer specific controls Type I – a Type I is a report on policies and procedures placed in operation as of a specified point in time. ISAE 3402/SSAE 18/SSAE 18 Type I reports evaluate the design effectiveness of a service provider’s controls and then confirms that the controls have been placed in operation as of a specific date. Type I reports are quite limited in their usability. SOC 1 Type I reports do not suffice for Sarbanes-Oxley Act purposes. Type II – a Type II is a report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for a period of time (usually 6 or 12 months). ISAE 3402/SSAE 18 SOC 1 Type II reports include the examination and confirmation steps involved in a Type I examination include an evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the controls for a period of at least six consecutive calendar months. Most user organizations require their service provider to undergo the Type II level examination for the greater level of assurance it provides. SOC reports that fall under “customer specific or customer leveraged should not start until 6 months post contract signing. Why SOC 1 Type ll Reports are Useful There are two primary reasons SOC 1 Type II reports are useful. First, SOC 1 is accepted for use by customers in their reporting of controls over financial reporting. Reporting on internal controls over financial reporting were brought into focus by regulatory actions such as the United States’ Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act dictates what publicly traded companies must do to assert to the effectiveness of controls over their financial reporting. Such assertions are used as input to what the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) calls the 10-K report found in publicly traded companies’ Annual Reports. SOX applies to any company that trades on the US Stock Exchange. SOC 1 reports will be prepared in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 and with International Standards for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) No. 3402. Secondly, rather than have hundreds of customers and their auditors coming into a Service Organization (DXC in this instance) to conduct audits, these reports can be delivered to any in-scope Customer as a substitute for the Customer conducting its own audit. So, based upon the Customer’s needs and applicability of the report(s), the delivery organization can alleviate demands for what could be redundant testing/auditing. [bookmark: _Toc499646082] [bookmark: _Toc21953522]Develop Solution Design [bookmark: _Toc499646083][bookmark: _Toc21953523]General Solution Design Base Reports SOC 1 Reports Unless another report is explicitly requested by the customer, one or more of the SOC 1 Base Reports (Shared Environments – historically called Site Reports) are typically provided to the customer interested in Sarbanes-Oxley financial controls reporting. Verify with the customer if they want a copy of the SOC 1 because there are charges associated with it. by Delivery Center. Some sites may be grouped together to save on costs. For SOC 1 Base Reports, a standard quoting mechanism may be used to calculate these costs for the opportunity. See ‘Configurator’ section in this guide for further details on the standard quoting mechanism. Unless another report is explicitly requested by the customer, the shared SOC 1 is what is typically provided . Verify with the customer that they need a copy of the SOC 1 because there are charges associated with it. SOC 2 Reports A SOC 2 is a report on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy. A SOC 2 cannot be used to replace a SOC 1 based on AICPA guidelines A SOC 2 should not be used for financial reporting such as SOX. SOC 2 is used by customers to ensure security practices are followed based on the contract In other words, for auditing purposes not specifically focused on satisfying internal controls over financial reporting, SOC 2 reports could be required. These reports will focus on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and/or privacy. SOC 2 may or may not be requested along with a SOC 1. SOC 1 is focused on controls relevant to financial reporting. SOC 2 is focused on security controls. SOC 2 reports that are shared and focus on a Delivery Center focus on the the Security Principle. The Virtual Private Cloud SOC 2 covers Secruity and Availability. If the customer requires other principle the report will be noted as a customer specific and costs fall outside of the shared environment pricing. Customer Leveraged Reports Customer Leveraged Reports include Base plus Logical Access Testing. For Logical Access Testing: Cost is not based on number of servers. Sample sizes for server testing is normally between 1-25 depending on total number of servers in scope. Cost is based on number of platforms in scope. The Customer will receive a report with the relevant site information and operating system/database logical access for their operating platforms only. The table below lists the standard operating systems typically included in scope: HPUX Mainframe Stratus VOS IBMi HP Non Stop Tru64 IBM AIX Open VMS VMWare Linux Oracle Solaris Windows Oracle database SQL database DB2  Be mindful and consider the following with regard to platform types (Operating Systems and uses of servers). You may have an opportunity to trim these from what you are considering as you quote the costs for report production. These can have an impact on actual cost as well as reporting results. Servers to include: Servers must be in production “supported” status to be included in the inventory SOX servers only that are used for the customer’s financial reporting Servers that have been verified for compliance Given there is a high risk of deviations and the fact that they are not normally considered important for financial reporting, exclude these types of servers/databases: Platforms with Customer administrative rights or elevated privileges Platforms that do not have Customer data Platforms NOT managed by DXC or are managed by the customer or a third party or using customer dedicated tools. Platforms that are decommissioned at any time during the review period (retain change tickets) Test, model office, development, transitioning, file, DXC tools management servers, print and mail servers The reason for server exclusions: Increased risk of qualified objectives (negative) in the reports Increased risk of delays to the audit schedule, which could delay the final report Increased costs to the account/Customer Improper scoping NOTE: If the customer requires that you include any of the above type servers, then please set up a one-on-one meeting with the TPA Program team to discuss possible options. Other items to consider: If servers not managed to DXC standards, then customer’s policies/standards documents must be providedThe standards must be updated annually DXC is contractually required to follow customer standards and the standards are not available then DXC standards are used by default Customer-dedicated tools and processes may only in scope if managed by DXC. Customer must not be able to change DXC managed activities. Application level controls are considered customer specific and will require a separate quote Customer Specific Reports Customer Specific Reports vary widely based the control objectives the customer wants in scope. The costs vary widely based on the scope. Smallest cost is $12k and up to $1M. Customers request our service because it can save them money and cost and also provides a third party opinion. To request quoting for Customer Specific SOC 1 Controls reporting, SOC 2 reporting, please go to this link, read the instructions Tab first. Next, click on the Scoping Questionnaire Tab and fill out the appropriate questionnaire sections. Submit the completed questionnaire by emailing it to ISAE3402@dxc.com which will send it to the TPA SOC Reporting team. Answer the questions in the appropriate questionnaire as best you can with the knowledge you currently have of the customer and the solution strategy to be proposed. Once you have submitted the questionnaire, it is a good measure to alert the TPA SOC Reporting team. They will review your request and get back with you regarding any missing information or if they need clarifications.

NOTES: Additional guidance from Legal AUDIT Contracting Rules: If customer has Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)/financial controls audit requirements: DXC’s preference is to provide customer an ISAE 3402/SSAE 18 System and Service Organization Control 1 (SOC 1), Type 2, report, released annually, that includes DXC’s financially relevant standard IT processes and DXC-defined controls that align to the AICPA’s SOC 1 audit guidance. Customer can be included within scope once their processes have been fully transitioned and managed by DXC for a minimum of 6 months. The cost of the required standard SOC 1 report(s) should be added to the cost model and charges. If customer is not using DXC standard practices, requires a customer specific SOC 1 report, or has specific SOX 404 and/or security requirements, the requirements need to be assessed during the bid process and tailored accordingly. The costs (both internal and external) of any customer-specific reports should be passed through to customer, or added to the cost model and charges.

The Base Package is aligned to a set of specific DXC Delivery Centers, Regional Delivery Centers, and Cloud (Leveraged) Infrastructure for which SOC audit assessments and reports are generated and can be leveraged for use with any customer with systems at those sites. Most standard and leveraged SOC 1 reporting is produced/delivered to accounts in October and November annually.

The Virtual Private Cloud report covers both Security and Availability. Note: see general internet info on SOC 2 Trust Services Principles here. The SOC 1 Central IT (Controls) Report is new in 2019. The report is a rolling 12 month report, and will be made be available 3 times per year. Review period ends will be April, September and December. The report includes the following control areas: Change Management, Incident Management, Network Access and Data Backup. This report is best used for customers that are supported from a Regional Delivery Center (formerly known as Global Operations Center). Physical Security is not included. This report does not replace a Delivery Center SOC 1 or SOC 2. SOC 2 reporting is generally more expensive to produce than SOC 1 due to further processes and testing requirements. Customer Leveraged Customer Leveraged will include additional controls beyond Base that relate to logical access for servers and/or databases. The cost of these reports are $20,000 for the first platform and $17,500 for each additional platform Customer Specific Customer Specific reports may include the base and leveraged activities but will also include areas that are specific to a customer such as application management, transaction processing, add-ons to third party cloud providers.

Forward costing should be validated with the DXC TPA SOC Team. See “Key Contacts” Section 10.3. This team can confirm what, if any reporting, this customer is currently receiving (which sites, which Operating Systems, current costs, etc.). Standard and leveraged SOC 1 reporting is typically delivered to accounts in the October or November time-frame, so costs within your CMT should align accordingly. Timeframe will be dictated by the customers fiscal year end. Does your customer require logical access to be included in the ISAE3402 SOC 1 report? If NO, then… The Site or Central IT report can be used to satisfy the customer’s requirements, if needed. Accounts may still want to ensure data backup servers and firewalls are provided in the inventory templates in order for them to appear in the Site Reports. No action is required from the account if the customer does not have backup servers, firewalls or HP ES managed tools to include in scope of testing If YES, then… Account teams will be responsible for inventory submissions, backup server instances, firewall populations, and identification of all tools that should be in scope Testing timelines and activities will be leveraged across multiple customers in order to lessen costs, therefore, it is critical that timelines are followed to avoid added costs to be passed to the account team [bookmark: _Toc499646092][bookmark: _Toc21953530]Partner Strategy DXC partners with Deloitte & Touche LLP to conduct the DXC SOC Audits for DXC Managed services.

SSAE 16/SSAE 18 and ISAE 3402 are the result of a collaborative effort put forth by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), a standard-setting board of the International Federation of Accountants and the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Both entities closely aligned each of their respective standards in an attempt to follow a growing move towards more international, globally accepted accounting standards. SOC Reports A SOC 1 Report (System and Organization Controls Report) is a report on Controls at a Service Organization which are relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting. SOC 2 Report is intended to meet the needs of a broad range of users that need to understand internal control at a service organization as it relates to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy. These reports are performed using the AICPA Guide: Reporting on Controls at a Service Organizations Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy and are intended for use by stakeholders (e.g., customers, regulators, business partners, suppliers, directors) of the service organization that have a thorough understanding of the service organization and its internal controls. These reports assist with the following: Oversight of the organization Vendor management program Internal corporate governance and risk management processes Regulatory oversight While the SOC 1 report is mainly concerned with examining controls over financial reporting, the SOC 2 reports focus more on the pre-defined, standardized benchmarks for controls related to security, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of the Delivery Center’s system and information. SOC 2 examines the details of Delivery Center testing and operational effectiveness Essentially, these SOC reports reflect the controls described (provided) by the service organization (i.e., DXC), the tests of those controls as performed by the service auditor, the results of those tests, the service organization’s assertion of the operating effectiveness of those controls, and the service auditor’s opinion on the operating effectiveness of the tested controls. These are independent, objective reports on the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls at a service organization. The reports provide a uniform reporting format for organizations to disclose their control activities and processes to their customer(s). Examination Report on Controls (ER) Less common report, now called [Examination Report on Controls] previously referred to as Custom Criteria Reports (CCR) reports Controls at a Service Organization based on specific criteria, but does not require a control environment to be reviewed. It is a limited scope engagement with an auditor's opinion. Provides an auditor's opinion specific to the controls tested. Type I - Provides an auditor's opinion on the design of the environment being audited Type II - Provides an auditor's opinion on the design and operating effectiveness of the environment being audited Add language below: ER Reports. If an ER report is required by Customer XXX, please contact the TPA program lead for pricing and timing (reports delivery). ​Agreed Upon Procedures (AUP) Less common report, Report on System and Controls at a Service Organization based on agreed upon procedures between the user entity, their external financial auditor, DXC and DXC's auditing firm. Primarily used to ensure remediation has been completed as stated in the SOC 1 or SOC 2 report. These reports do not offer an auditor's opinion. Point in Time audit with only the results of testing being provided to the customer/user entity (No Auditor Opinion provided). Access letter and sign off on the procedures is required. Add language below: AUP Reports. If an AUP report is required by Customer XXX, please contact the TPA program lead for pricing and timing (reports delivery). Auditor’s Opinion Below are standard SOC reporting terms for general awareness. Solutioners should not need to refer to these terms as part of the Solutioning phase. DXC Technology are considered ""dual"" opinion reports. The auditor's opinion will take into consideration both the ISAE3402 and the SSAE18 standard. The standards are very similar and will be accepted by the DXC customer. The auditor's opinion can be found in Section 1I of the report. The opinion explains the scope of the audit and the auditor's opinion in regards to the controls in place. There are two types of opinion, unqualified and qualified. Unqualified - The auditor will state that DXC Technology meets the objectives listed in the report during the review period. There could be deviations noted but based on the overall tests DXC meets the control objectives. Qualified – The auditor will state that DXC did not meet one or more control objectives. Based on the testing that was completed the auditor has found sufficient reason to state that the objectives was not met. A qualified opinion is a negative result that could cause your Customer to be concerned. Please note that a qualified opinon states that an objective was not met. The auditor is stating that all objecives were met as stated in the report but the auditor will will qualify their opinion by stating that objective x was not met for this reason xxxx Types of Quaifications Scope Limitation - A scope limitation is a qualification but it is due to the auditor not being able to offer an opinion on a specific area that was not in place during the full review period. Scope limitations are not normally a concern but keep your customer informed of any scope limitation to ensure it is not considered a negative result. Operating Effectiveness – During testing the auditor found that the process in place was not met. The deviaton(s), also known as an excepton is severe enough that it poses a risk to the customer. Cutomers will expect an immediate correction or a plan to correct the deviations.Design – This is the most serious type of qualification. The auditor is stating that based on a lack of process or the fact that the process does not meet industry standards , DXC cannot meet the control objective as stated.

Verbal orders, letters of intent, draft documents and memos of understanding are not acceptable forms of evidence of an arrangement. The following documents are acceptable for sales booking purposes: Formal agreements (i.e. Services agreements, Consulting agreements, DXC license agreements) MPSA/MSA/Framework agreements are not reportable when initially signed. Associated task orders, SOW, POs, work orders ARE reportable SOWs Work Orders, Task Orders, Service Orders, or similar documents Change Requests or Amendments to existing contracts for new scope including pricing details (Copy of existing contracts if pricing details are missing in Change Requests or Amendments) Evidence of online acceptance via DXC or client internal workflow systems Sales Booking accepts actual signatures of both parties or electronic/digital signatures. Whether or not actual signatures are available depends on the client, the documentation, and the process at the account. If you are bundling multiple sales together in one opportunity record, at a minimum, provide one contract that represents the sales included in the bundle and reflects the Close Date selected in SFDC.  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential In order to report a sale, there must be a valid, executed contract. The contract can take many forms, as described on this slide. The important points for booking purposes are: Proof that the sale is valid – client has accepted DXC’s offer of services Close Date entered in SFDC is displayed in the contract. If the client signed on one date and DXC on another date, the latest date is the official Close Date The document may be in a language that you or someone on your team cannot speak. In those situations, contact the appropriate regional sales operations team for assistance, using the contacts you previously consulted in your legacy organizations (ES or CSC). 11 Determine Reportability / Reportable Value The Bookings and Backlog Policy provides guidance to determine: If a sale is reportable and, Reportable booking value Exceptions to Sales Booking require approval from Sell CFO. The pursuit team follows the policy to determine reportable value If there is a limitation on reporting and the financial model approved at Delegation of Authority (DOA) must be changed, Sales works with the person who provided financial model support to update the model  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential The legacy ES and CSC policies were similar and have been harmonized based on DXC needs. 12 October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 13 October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 14 October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 15 October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 16 Bundling Sales into One Record Small sales to one client can be bundled into one reported record. To do this, combine the sales prior to creating an Opportunity ID in SFDC, following the bundling rules: Total Contract Value (TCV) of the bundle should not exceed 5M USD TCV of each individual sale included in the bundle should not exceed 250K USD All opportunities in each bundle must be with the same customer and contract Bundles should not reflect multiple regions Bundles should not include multiple Opportunity Types. Separate bundles should be submitted for New Logo, Cross Sell and so forth There is no limit to the number of deals which can be included in one bundle Bundles must reflect sales with close dates and revenue start date in the same fiscal quarter Dates reflected in the bundle should be as follows: The start date should be the earliest start date of the sales included in the bundle The end date should be the latest end date of the sales included in the bundle The sign date should be the latest sold date included in the bundle There is no obligation to include a deal in a bundle and care should be taken that due to ABR calculation, inclusion in a bundle could reduce the reportable ABR (especially in cases where the deal with the latest sold date has a duration of 9 or more months). Bundles need to be broken out by the Major Offering. WBS elements are assigned at the Major Offering level. Multi-term deals in Bundles can Adversely Impact ABR Calculation ~ Group Bundles Carefully October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Smaller sales can be bundled into one opportunity record in SFDC to streamline sales booking and reporting. It is important that the rules above are followed to help ensure consistency. Note that bundles of NSSRs have additional guidance related to naming conventions and bundling NSSRs on a monthly basis 17 Create the POR Financial Model – Economic & Reporting A financial model is needed in order to validate the financials entered into SFDC. Since data is manually entered into SFDC and SFDC is the source of truth for sales booking, it is important that the financials can be validated in the sales booking process. If a Pricer has provided support during the pursuit, the pricer performs these tasks; otherwise, someone else on the sales team creates the model. Acceptable financial modeling tools: Xpress E3T Moby PACE (trainings available on pricing tool training SharePoint) There are two financial models created for sales booking purposes: Economic and Reporting Economic POR Model: The Economic Model is the model approved at governance and represents the most likely performance of the contract. The model is updated to reflect the signed contract, resulting in the Economic POR Model. The Reporting POR Model reflects the contract’s revenue stream unless the reportable amount is limited by the Bookings & Backlog Policy. Typical limitations to reporting the full TCV include lack of minimum revenue or volume commitments, insufficient termination fees, optional services, or flexible contract term. This limitation generally results in IDIQ for the portion of the contract impacted by the policy. To create the POR financial models: Update the financial model approved at governance/DOA to reflect the signed contract. If the sale did not require DOA, create a financial model reflecting the signed contract. Apply the Bookings & Backlog Policy to the Economic POR Model to determine the reportable value Beginning with all deals reported for 3QFY19, it is mandatory to provide a Deal Review Chart (P&L) and Plan of Record (POR) text files from a standard pricing tool in order to book a sale in SFDC irrespective of size. To obtain standard pricing tool access and training, go to the DXC Standard Pricing Tool Training SharePoint. Contact information is also available on the site. Note: The financial summary report generated from MOBY is also is called “Sales Booking Template”. That is accepted.  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 18 Generate the POR Text Files If the financial modeling tool was Xpress, E3T, Moby or CAPTN, POR text files are generated and included in the artifacts attached in SFDC during Certify & Close Xpress Select the New Sales Reporting tab, then the NSR Configuration icon If the sign date was not populated on the Edit Opportunity or the New Opportunity screen, check the “Opportunity Signed” box and select the Signed Date via the calendar pop-up POR Cost Model Type field: If the Economic and Reporting models are the same, the selection should be Both If the Economic and Reporting models are different, select Economic when viewing the Economic model; select Reporting when viewing the Reporting model Assign Managing Countries – This is the country that is managing the invoicing. The default selection is the same as the Invoicing Country previously selected in the model. If the Invoicing and Managing countries are not the same, change the Managing Country selection Select the Submit POR button. Xpress will prompt you for a location on your PC to sale the file(s). Note that Xpress will also send the files to the POR Holding Area on the Xpress server E3T On the top-level menu bar, select Add-Ins | E3T Features | Sales Opportunity I/O | Export Text Files for Sales Booking (before initiating make sure to convert E3T file to Budget FX) E3T will validate fields and provide messages to prompt you for action if conditions are not met If the validations are met, the “Exporting EDW” window appears Select the Sales Type, then the Model Type (Reporting or Economic) Click OK The file is generated and saved to your PC Repeat the steps to run the text file for the other Model Type (Reporting or Economic) Detailed instructions: https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/e3t/webdocs.html?target=Fixed_Budget_FX_Rates Moby In the left menu section, click on Quotes Identify the quote that needs to be marked as ‘Won’ Change the status to ‘Won’ Enter sign date Click Generate POR Adjust Revenue Schedule if required Tag Revenue & Cost by Offering Click on Create.

Once locked, no changes are permitted to the model. If corrections need to be made to a submitted POR file, the file must be rejected if they are in the Pending NSR Approval or Duplicate status. Once rejected, the financial model will be unlocked and will allow changes to be made and re-submitted. If the original file has already been approved the user will need to save a copy of the financial model using the Edit Financial Model screen. This copy will be unlocked, allowing new POR files to be sent. October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 21 POR Status Panel in Xpress Status Description Pending Synchronization When the file is first submitted it will be in this status until Xpress syncs Pending NSR Approval The POR file is awaiting approval Rejected File has been rejected by the sales booking validator. The model will need to be corrected and the POR text files generated again Duplicate This occurs when a file is already Pending NSR Approval and a new file is submitted. The files Pending NSR Approval need to be rejected before new    files can be submitted. Deleted The file was deleted in the holding area Approved The file has been approved but has not been sent to Horizon Sent to Horizon The POR file was approved and sent to Horizon  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 22 If the person preparing the Xpress model submits the POR files in Xpress then realizes there is a change and the POR files need to be fixed, send an email to DXC Sales Booking for further instructions BEFORE making changes to the model The sales booking validator will go into the Xpress holding area and reject the files If the POR files have been approved, the sales booking validator will need to cancel them in Xpress holding area before the Xpress modeler make changes to the model via the “Save financial as” functionality in Xpress and run/submit the POR files. This timing is very important – do not take action in Xpress until working with DXC Sales Booking POR Text File Approval, Rejection October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential . 23 Certify & Close October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Evaluate Contract Signature Certify & Close Compensation Master Data Validate Internal / External Reporting Finance Data Warehouse October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 25 Certify & Close Who: Team who has responsibility for the sale (Sales or Account Team) What: Provide the required documentation to book a sale and confirm that the sale follows legal and booking policies When: Occurs continuously throughout the quarter. For a sale to be included in that quarter’s bookings, Certify & Close must occur by Work Day 4 in the month following the end of the quarter. The dates are approximate and depends on weekdays, holidays and the Finance workday calendar. If required, the deadlines may get extended based on Sell CFO approval. October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Certify & Close is the act of flagging a deal as sold in SFDC – loading submission requirements, entering the sign date, changing the sales stage is changed to 06, certifying that the sale is valid and meets the booking policy C&C also performs a validation of the Delegation of Authority requirements for that particular deal. Certify & Close is typically performed by the Opportunity Owner, but anyone on the sales team can Certify & Close a deal. Deals should be certified and closed as soon as possible after contract signature, typically within 2 weeks. As mentioned on this slide, the dates displayed here are approximate. 26 Prerequisites to Certify & Close in SFDC Before certifying and closing an opportunity in SFDC, ensure the following: You have followed the Delegation of Authority (DoA) process (completed the required screens and obtained approval in SFDC) You have the following documents: Contract Profit & Loss Statement which includes these fields at a minimum: TCV (aka CR), ABR, Total Account Operating Profit (Total Margin) and IYR POR text files (if Xpress, Moby, E3T or PACE) Approval for exception to the Bookings & Backlog Policy (if applicable)  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Contract is the same pre-merger definition for both ES and CSC. If you are bundling multiple sales together into one opportunity record, provide the contract which reflects the Sign Date entered into SFDC on the Certify & Close screen P&L should be the Deal Review Chart from a standard financial modeling tool – Xpress, E3T. Executive Financial Summary from CAPTN and Sales Booking Template (PDF) format from Moby. POR text files are only produced by Xpress, E3T, Moby and CAPTN; if you did not use one of these financial modeling tools, you do not have POR text files to submit The Bookings & Backlog Policy provides the rules around what is reportable. If you recommend deviating from the policy, approval is required from the Sell CFO. Approval should be in an email format and included in the sales booking documentation 27 Important Points to Keep in Mind You must complete DOA and have the submission requirements in hand before you Certify & Close – you cannot change the sales stage to 06 then come back later and complete the screen The Close Date selected on the Certify & Close screen must reflect the contract. SFDC allows you to select a past date on the Certify & Close screen It’s recommended that you zip the files and upload on the Certify & Close screen. However, if you did not do this, you can upload the files under the Notes & Attachments section in SFDC Please do not load Certify & Close documentation on the DOA screens Be fully aware of fields that will be reviewed during Booking Validation to limit rejects and to speed up booking validations Double-check the SFDC fields to ensure accuracy and avoid rejects October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 28 Documentation Required to Book a Sale Sales should zip the files into one file and attach to the Certify & Close screen in SFDC At this point, we do not expect users to check the box on the C&C screen since the DRC, text files, and exception approval to the SFDC record are required even if the contract cannot be attached due to limitations with sharing If files are not attached to Certify & Close screen, they should be attached to the Contracts section (if possible); otherwise they can be attached in the Notes & Attachments section What is Required When it is Required Guidance Contract All booked sales For bundles, attach one contract which represents the other sales in the bundle and reflects the Close Date entered in SFDC See earlier slide for list of acceptable documents SFDC accepts a maximum file size of 10MB Deal Review Chart/Sales Booking Template (PDF format) /Executive Financial Summary from Financial Modeling Tool All booked sales Deal Review Chart from Xpress & E3T, Sales Booking Template (PDF format) from Moby, Executive Financial Summary from PACE.

If the deal was a duplicate, the financial values should be opposite sign of the reported values If the correction does not impact financials, create two new Opportunity IDs in SFDC: Reversal of the reported opportunity with the same non-financial values, opposite sign financial values Opportunity with corrected non-financial values and financials with the same values as reported Enter the Reported Opportunity Name/IDs in the Related Opportunity field to illustrate the connection. This will facilitate identification of a correction in SFDC Opportunity Name should include “Sales Booking Correction to OPX-nnn” where OPX-nnn is the reported Opportunity ID  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 72 POR Models There is a lot of focus on POR reporting and it is important to correct the financial models in case of corrections. The Deal Review Charts and POR text files must be attached in SFDC. Examples are given in Slide#8. Decision and Close date Close date = Original Opportunity Close Date (Opportunity owner should back-date the close date when performing the Certify & Close Process) Typically the Close Date = Original Opportunity Close Date. Occasionally the Correction Deal is to correct the original close date. In that scenario the Close Date will not = the Original Opportunity Close Date. Decision Date = Original Opportunity Decision Date (This field is auto-populated based on Close Date) Reported period = the Reported Period of the Correction. (Field is populated via batch process after quarter close) Note: Even though the correction is for a previous quarter reported sale, the impact would be for the quarter in which it is validated and reported. DOA Approval Most correction entries will not require re-approval via the full DOA provided the below criteria are met. Note: If DOA is required you will be notified. Original Opportunity is compliant with DOA requirements for the Deal Category Correction is for the same Account Correction has the same Offering Family/Lead Offering (unless the correction is to change the offering) Correction has the same Opportunity Type (unless the correction is to change the Opportunity type) Mandatory requirements for correcting a previously reported sale or validated opportunity  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Process to Correct a Previously Reported Sale or Validated Opportunity Error in Validated or Previously reported sale Opportunity Owner/User to create Correction Oppty in SFDC TCV of the opportunity should be >= 50,000 USD Cannot create a Correction Oppty in SFDC No Yes Send an email to DXC Sales Booking Mailbox with the Correction Opportunity Id and reason for correction with details of correction made.

Once you determine the start date and end date for the calculation, the revenue that will be recognized during that period is totaled and the result is ABR. If the sign date is the first day of the month, ABR is the revenue that will be recognized starting the sign month for the next 11 months (total of 12 months). Contract Signature Date = 1 April 2017; ABR = the total expected revenue from April 2017 through March 2018 If the sign date is after the first of the month, ABR is the revenue that will be recognized starting the sign month for the next 12 months (total of 13 months). Thirteen months is used to help ensure there are at least 12 months included in ABR as the sign date moves later in the month. Contract Signature Date = 2 April 2017; ABR = expected revenue from April 2017 through April 2018 Contract Signature Date = 30 April 2017; ABR = expected revenue from April 2017 through April 2018 You will not have 12 months included in the calculation if the revenue does not start close to the sign month. The further away the revenue start month is from the sign month, the lower the ABR. ABR will not be higher than TCV – the maximum amount of ABR is the TCV How do we treat revenue that is recognized in arrears (special cases when the financial model’s revenue start is prior to sign date)? If Revenue Start Month is not equal to Sign Date Month and the dates are in the same fiscal quarter – ABR will be 12 months starting from Revenue Start Date/Month. If Revenue Start Month is not equal to Sign Date Month and the revenue start date is prior to the beginning of the fiscal quarter of the sign date – ABR will be 12 months starting from first month of the quarter of the Sign Date. How do we treat revenue when revenue start month equals sign date month? If Revenue Start Month is equal to Sign Date Month, where Sign date is 1st of the Month – ABR will be 12 months starting from Sign Date If Revenue Start Month is equal to Sign Date Month, where Sign date is after 1st of the Month – ABR will be 13 months starting from Sign Date How do we treat deals with Delayed Recognition due to protests ? • If a contract is protested, the Contact Signature Date will be the date the contract is cleared of all protests. Where is ABR? • SFDC requires manual data entry of ABR by major offering/offering family on the Products (Offerings & Services) screen. SFDC calculates and displays the total ABR on the Opportunity Detail screen. The total ABR is validated during the Sales Booking process. • Total ABR for the deal is available on reports from standard pricing tools such as Xpress, E3T and Moby. What’s the difference between ABR and IYR? • IYR (In Year Revenue) is based on expected revenue over the fiscal year of the sign year while the ABR is the revenue over ~12 months from the sign date. • Typically, ABR will be greater than IYR as the contract sign date moves further into a fiscal year. October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Annual Booked Revenue (ABR): Examples Example 1: If a project start from June 2017, but the Contract Award Date (sign date) is January 1, 2017, how to calculate the ABR? If signature date is January 1 , then total revenue during January-December = ABR. Since the start date is June 2017, the months with revenue are June – December so the total revenue June – December equals ABR  Example 2: If a project start from June 2017, but the Contract Award Date (sign date) is January 5, 2017, how to calculate the ABR? If signature date is January 5, then total revenue during January-January = ABR. Since the start date is June 2017, the months with revenue are June – January so the total revenue June – January equals ABR  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 83 Annual Booked Revenue (ABR): Examples Example 3: If a project start from June 2017, duration is 4 months, but the Contract Award Date (sign date) is November 1, 2017 , how to calculate ABR? Since the start date is prior to the sign date, the ABR calculation begins with the later of revenue start or beginning of the sign quarter. Revenue start is June 2017, sign quarter is Q3 (Oct-Dec). So the later of the two is Oct 2017, thus revenue during Oct 2017 - Sep 2018 = ABR. Since the months with revenue are June 2017 – Sep 2017, ABR is zero since the last month of revenue is September (duration is 4 months)  Example 4: If a project start from February 1, 2018, duration is 24 months, but the Contract Award Date (sign date) is January 1, 2017, how to calculate ABR? If signature date is January 1 , then total revenue during January-December = ABR. Since the start date is Feb 2018, there is no revenue Jan – Dec, so ABR = zero.

Verbal orders, letters of intent, draft documents and memos of understanding are not acceptable forms of evidence of an arrangement. The following documents are acceptable for sales booking purposes: Formal agreements (i.e. Services agreements, Consulting agreements, DXC license agreements) MPSA/MSA/Framework agreements are not reportable when initially signed. Associated task orders, SOW, POs, work orders ARE reportable SOWs Work Orders, Task Orders, Service Orders, or similar documents Change Requests or Amendments to existing contracts for new scope including pricing details (Copy of existing contracts if pricing details are missing in Change Requests or Amendments) Evidence of online acceptance via DXC or client internal workflow systems Sales Booking accepts actual signatures of both parties or electronic/digital signatures. Whether or not actual signatures are available depends on the client, the documentation, and the process at the account. If you are bundling multiple sales together in one opportunity record, at a minimum, provide one contract that represents the sales included in the bundle and reflects the Close Date selected in SFDC.  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential In order to report a sale, there must be a valid, executed contract. The contract can take many forms, as described on this slide. The important points for booking purposes are: Proof that the sale is valid – client has accepted DXC’s offer of services Close Date entered in SFDC is displayed in the contract. If the client signed on one date and DXC on another date, the latest date is the official Close Date The document may be in a language that you or someone on your team cannot speak. In those situations, contact the appropriate regional sales operations team for assistance, using the contacts you previously consulted in your legacy organizations (ES or CSC). 11 Determine Reportability / Reportable Value The Bookings and Backlog Policy provides guidance to determine: If a sale is reportable and, Reportable booking value Exceptions to Sales Booking require approval from Sell CFO. The pursuit team follows the policy to determine reportable value If there is a limitation on reporting and the financial model approved at Delegation of Authority (DOA) must be changed, Sales works with the person who provided financial model support to update the model  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential The legacy ES and CSC policies were similar and have been harmonized based on DXC needs. 12 October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 13 October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 14 October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 15 October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 16 Bundling Sales into One Record Small sales to one client can be bundled into one reported record. To do this, combine the sales prior to creating an Opportunity ID in SFDC, following the bundling rules: Total Contract Value (TCV) of the bundle should not exceed 5M USD TCV of each individual sale included in the bundle should not exceed 250K USD All opportunities in each bundle must be with the same customer and contract Bundles should not reflect multiple regions Bundles should not include multiple Opportunity Types. Separate bundles should be submitted for New Logo, Cross Sell and so forth There is no limit to the number of deals which can be included in one bundle Bundles must reflect sales with close dates and revenue start date in the same fiscal quarter Dates reflected in the bundle should be as follows: The start date should be the earliest start date of the sales included in the bundle The end date should be the latest end date of the sales included in the bundle The sign date should be the latest sold date included in the bundle There is no obligation to include a deal in a bundle and care should be taken that due to ABR calculation, inclusion in a bundle could reduce the reportable ABR (especially in cases where the deal with the latest sold date has a duration of 9 or more months). Bundles need to be broken out by the Major Offering. WBS elements are assigned at the Major Offering level. Multi-term deals in Bundles can Adversely Impact ABR Calculation ~ Group Bundles Carefully October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Smaller sales can be bundled into one opportunity record in SFDC to streamline sales booking and reporting. It is important that the rules above are followed to help ensure consistency. Note that bundles of NSSRs have additional guidance related to naming conventions and bundling NSSRs on a monthly basis 17 Create the POR Financial Model – Economic & Reporting A financial model is needed in order to validate the financials entered into SFDC. Since data is manually entered into SFDC and SFDC is the source of truth for sales booking, it is important that the financials can be validated in the sales booking process. If a Pricer has provided support during the pursuit, the pricer performs these tasks; otherwise, someone else on the sales team creates the model. Acceptable financial modeling tools: Xpress E3T Moby PACE (trainings available on pricing tool training SharePoint) There are two financial models created for sales booking purposes: Economic and Reporting Economic POR Model: The Economic Model is the model approved at governance and represents the most likely performance of the contract. The model is updated to reflect the signed contract, resulting in the Economic POR Model. The Reporting POR Model reflects the contract’s revenue stream unless the reportable amount is limited by the Bookings & Backlog Policy. Typical limitations to reporting the full TCV include lack of minimum revenue or volume commitments, insufficient termination fees, optional services, or flexible contract term. This limitation generally results in IDIQ for the portion of the contract impacted by the policy. To create the POR financial models: Update the financial model approved at governance/DOA to reflect the signed contract. If the sale did not require DOA, create a financial model reflecting the signed contract. Apply the Bookings & Backlog Policy to the Economic POR Model to determine the reportable value Beginning with all deals reported for 3QFY19, it is mandatory to provide a Deal Review Chart (P&L) and Plan of Record (POR) text files from a standard pricing tool in order to book a sale in SFDC irrespective of size. To obtain standard pricing tool access and training, go to the DXC Standard Pricing Tool Training SharePoint. Contact information is also available on the site. Note: The financial summary report generated from MOBY is also is called “Sales Booking Template”. That is accepted.

Once locked, no changes are permitted to the model. If corrections need to be made to a submitted POR file, the file must be rejected if they are in the Pending NSR Approval or Duplicate status. Once rejected, the financial model will be unlocked and will allow changes to be made and re-submitted. If the original file has already been approved the user will need to save a copy of the financial model using the Edit Financial Model screen. This copy will be unlocked, allowing new POR files to be sent.

For a sale to be included in that quarter’s bookings, Certify & Close must occur by Work Day 4 in the month following the end of the quarter. The dates are approximate and depends on weekdays, holidays and the Finance workday calendar. If required, the deadlines may get extended based on Sell CFO approval. October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Certify & Close is the act of flagging a deal as sold in SFDC – loading submission requirements, entering the sign date, changing the sales stage is changed to 06, certifying that the sale is valid and meets the booking policy C&C also performs a validation of the Delegation of Authority requirements for that particular deal. Certify & Close is typically performed by the Opportunity Owner, but anyone on the sales team can Certify & Close a deal. Deals should be certified and closed as soon as possible after contract signature, typically within 2 weeks. As mentioned on this slide, the dates displayed here are approximate. 26 Prerequisites to Certify & Close in SFDC Before certifying and closing an opportunity in SFDC, ensure the following: You have followed the Delegation of Authority (DoA) process (completed the required screens and obtained approval in SFDC) You have the following documents: Contract Profit & Loss Statement which includes these fields at a minimum: TCV (aka CR), ABR, Total Account Operating Profit (Total Margin) and IYR POR text files (if Xpress, Moby, E3T or PACE) Approval for exception to the Bookings & Backlog Policy (if applicable)  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Contract is the same pre-merger definition for both ES and CSC. If you are bundling multiple sales together into one opportunity record, provide the contract which reflects the Sign Date entered into SFDC on the Certify & Close screen P&L should be the Deal Review Chart from a standard financial modeling tool – Xpress, E3T. Executive Financial Summary from CAPTN and Sales Booking Template (PDF) format from Moby. POR text files are only produced by Xpress, E3T, Moby and CAPTN; if you did not use one of these financial modeling tools, you do not have POR text files to submit The Bookings & Backlog Policy provides the rules around what is reportable. If you recommend deviating from the policy, approval is required from the Sell CFO. Approval should be in an email format and included in the sales booking documentation 27 Important Points to Keep in Mind You must complete DOA and have the submission requirements in hand before you Certify & Close – you cannot change the sales stage to 06 then come back later and complete the screen The Close Date selected on the Certify & Close screen must reflect the contract. SFDC allows you to select a past date on the Certify & Close screen It’s recommended that you zip the files and upload on the Certify & Close screen. However, if you did not do this, you can upload the files under the Notes & Attachments section in SFDC Please do not load Certify & Close documentation on the DOA screens Be fully aware of fields that will be reviewed during Booking Validation to limit rejects and to speed up booking validations Double-check the SFDC fields to ensure accuracy and avoid rejects October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 28 Documentation Required to Book a Sale Sales should zip the files into one file and attach to the Certify & Close screen in SFDC At this point, we do not expect users to check the box on the C&C screen since the DRC, text files, and exception approval to the SFDC record are required even if the contract cannot be attached due to limitations with sharing If files are not attached to Certify & Close screen, they should be attached to the Contracts section (if possible); otherwise they can be attached in the Notes & Attachments section What is Required When it is Required Guidance Contract All booked sales For bundles, attach one contract which represents the other sales in the bundle and reflects the Close Date entered in SFDC See earlier slide for list of acceptable documents SFDC accepts a maximum file size of 10MB Deal Review Chart/Sales Booking Template (PDF format) /Executive Financial Summary from Financial Modeling Tool All booked sales Deal Review Chart from Xpress & E3T, Sales Booking Template (PDF format) from Moby, Executive Financial Summary from PACE.

Once you determine the start date and end date for the calculation, the revenue that will be recognized during that period is totaled and the result is ABR. If the sign date is the first day of the month, ABR is the revenue that will be recognized starting the sign month for the next 11 months (total of 12 months). Contract Signature Date = 1 April 2017; ABR = the total expected revenue from April 2017 through March 2018 If the sign date is after the first of the month, ABR is the revenue that will be recognized starting the sign month for the next 12 months (total of 13 months). Thirteen months is used to help ensure there are at least 12 months included in ABR as the sign date moves later in the month. Contract Signature Date = 2 April 2017; ABR = expected revenue from April 2017 through April 2018 Contract Signature Date = 30 April 2017; ABR = expected revenue from April 2017 through April 2018 You will not have 12 months included in the calculation if the revenue does not start close to the sign month. The further away the revenue start month is from the sign month, the lower the ABR. ABR will not be higher than TCV – the maximum amount of ABR is the TCV How do we treat revenue that is recognized in arrears (special cases when the financial model’s revenue start is prior to sign date)? If Revenue Start Month is not equal to Sign Date Month and the dates are in the same fiscal quarter – ABR will be 12 months starting from Revenue Start Date/Month. If Revenue Start Month is not equal to Sign Date Month and the revenue start date is prior to the beginning of the fiscal quarter of the sign date – ABR will be 12 months starting from first month of the quarter of the Sign Date. How do we treat revenue when revenue start month equals sign date month? If Revenue Start Month is equal to Sign Date Month, where Sign date is 1st of the Month – ABR will be 12 months starting from Sign Date If Revenue Start Month is equal to Sign Date Month, where Sign date is after 1st of the Month – ABR will be 13 months starting from Sign Date How do we treat deals with Delayed Recognition due to protests ? • If a contract is protested, the Contact Signature Date will be the date the contract is cleared of all protests. Where is ABR? • SFDC requires manual data entry of ABR by major offering/offering family on the Products (Offerings & Services) screen. SFDC calculates and displays the total ABR on the Opportunity Detail screen. The total ABR is validated during the Sales Booking process. • Total ABR for the deal is available on reports from standard pricing tools such as Xpress, E3T and Moby. What’s the difference between ABR and IYR? • IYR (In Year Revenue) is based on expected revenue over the fiscal year of the sign year while the ABR is the revenue over ~12 months from the sign date. • Typically, ABR will be greater than IYR as the contract sign date moves further into a fiscal year.

If signature date is January 1 , then total revenue during January-December = ABR. Since the start date is June 2017, the months with revenue are June – December so the total revenue June – December equals ABR  Example 2: If a project start from June 2017, but the Contract Award Date (sign date) is January 5, 2017, how to calculate the ABR? If signature date is January 5, then total revenue during January-January = ABR. Since the start date is June 2017, the months with revenue are June – January so the total revenue June – January equals ABR  October 21, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential 83 Annual Booked Revenue (ABR): Examples Example 3: If a project start from June 2017, duration is 4 months, but the Contract Award Date (sign date) is November 1, 2017 , how to calculate ABR? Since the start date is prior to the sign date, the ABR calculation begins with the later of revenue start or beginning of the sign quarter. Revenue start is June 2017, sign quarter is Q3 (Oct-Dec). So the later of the two is Oct 2017, thus revenue during Oct 2017 - Sep 2018 = ABR. Since the months with revenue are June 2017 – Sep 2017, ABR is zero since the last month of revenue is September (duration is 4 months)  Example 4: If a project start from February 1, 2018, duration is 24 months, but the Contract Award Date (sign date) is January 1, 2017, how to calculate ABR? If signature date is January 1 , then total revenue during January-December = ABR. Since the start date is Feb 2018, there is no revenue Jan – Dec, so ABR = zero.

The Sales Booking policy and process steps are followed by all organizations and regions within DXC. 100% of all opportunities in SFDC must go through the Sales Booking process in order for the sale to be reported and commissions paid. Sales Booking must follow standard rules and policy since sales data is critical to: • Administering the DXC Sales Incentive Plan, which involves sales quota attainment, calculation of bonus and commission payment for teams engaged in sales pursuit activities • Measuring actual revenue and costs against the forecast for quarterly and monthly Finance reviews, Key Performance Indicators (KPI) measurement • Setting up the contract (including invoicing and master data (Client ID, Contract ID) in the financial system(s) • Forecasting a contract’s expected financials (revenue, expense, margin) • Understanding what is being sold – services, types of sales, trends • Measuring success and improving processes when sales booking data is the data used to build analysis Sales, Account teams and Finance teams are involved in processing sales (Certify & Close, validating). Groups that use sales booking data includes Sales Compensation, Sales Operations, Sales Finance, Finance Account Management, Revenue Management (finance), the Practices organization and DXC Finance Operations. Sales should be submitted in the month that they occur. The service level (SLA) for submissions is 15 days from contract signature. The peak time for sales booking is the last three weeks of the quarter; typically 50-60% of reported sales are submitted for validation during this time. Teams should strive to report sales as soon as they occur to ensure their sales can be reported in the quarter that they signed. If the sale is not validated by the “Final Sales Booking Validation Date” per the Sales Booking Process Calendar, the sale will not be included in that period’s reported new sales, but will be included in the next period’s reported sales. The DXC Sales Booking Web site contains sales booking process documentation.  https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseFinancialReporting/SalesBooking/SitePages/Home.aspx    Process Flow / Responsibilities  Training, Documentation, Contacts Sales booking training related to SFDC functionality is available on the What We Sell Web site (from the myDXC Web site, select the What We Sell link on the right side of the page).       All users can access the sales booking documentation on the DXC Sales Booking Web site. If you have questions, send an email to DXC Sales Booking (arch.communications@dxc.com). Process Duration  https://my.dxc.com/ https://my.dxc.com/ https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseFinancialReporting/SalesBooking/SitePages/Home.aspx mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com    The guidance below is per the legacy ES process. Process duration goals: 1. Have transactions approved on average within 16 workdays from the contract sold date. 2. Report nearly all transactions in the quarter when it was sold. The sales booking process follows a sequence with short timeframes.  The expected duration from Contract signature to Certify & Close is 0 to 15 workdays from date of sale or prior end of quarter.  The expected duration from Certify & Close to Booking Validation Complete is 0 to 1 workday. Transactions with TCV < 100 are system-approved and require no active approvals from Finance. The final reporting of transactions occurs quarterly. Once a quarter is reported, no changes to reported transactions can occur. If a changed to a reported sale is necessary, a correction is submitted. The correction process is in place. Do not sacrifice quality for time – while we are measuring against the sales booking duration targets, an accurate Plan of Record (POR) is extremely important. Do it right the first time – make sure the POR data is correct prior to Certify & Close. Process Calendar Sales Booking Connection to other Processes Sales team activities that will impact Sales Booking - by Sales Stage: Sales Stage Sales Team Activities that Impact Sales Booking 1 Enter opportunity in Salesforce.com (SFDC) (creates an Opportunity ID)    1 Determine if opportunity type = New Business 4 Finalize Opportunity Type 4/5 Determine service offering families reflected in the financial model 4/5 Consider what is reportable (using the DXC Bookings & Backlog Policy) 5 Prepare for Certify & Close (understand submission requirements, complete DOA) 6 Certify & Close in SFDC Sales Compensation / Sales Crediting For sales crediting to apply to a sale, the booking must be validated in SFDC. Sales Crediting should be based on the booked/reported value. Contact Sales Compensation or Sales Operations for process details. Master Data 1. Extract SFDC data – weekly “Sold” deals (SFDC Sales Stage 6) 2. Do mapping of Anaplan Extract with Template from SFDC Data 3. Update columns with data from extracts, confirm row formula copied to end of data list 4. Eliminate OPP ID already mapped (refer list maintained by Linda Dowlen) 5. Check for errors 6. Send completed OPP ID list to ERD DBM team for processing. 7. Where new Client or Contract IDs have been created, DBM team to send details to Region & Sales contacts listed 8. Linda Dowlen (ERD DBM) to send Sales Booking team updated OPP ID to Contract ID mapping list to be used for future submission cycles (Step 4, above)  Financial Forecasting Once a deal signs, POR data from Sales Booking should be the basis for the financial forecast in the ALM system. Before contract signing, pursuit data from SFDC is typically used in the forecast. When the source of the forecast is Sales Booking, if those who prepare the forecast think that there are inaccuracies with the POR data – dates, financial values, Opportunity Type, and so forth – the “forecaster” should send an email to DXC Sales Booking. An Administrator will provide Opportunity Owner and Cost Model Preparer information (preparer info is reflected in the POR text file) to the forecaster so that they can discuss what they are seeing. If a booked sale is inaccurate, it can be updated or corrected, depending on where it is in the process.  mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com    Evaluate Exceptions to Bookings & Backlog Policy Approval requirements for exceptions is stated in the policy.  All approved policy exceptions should be documented in e-mail. The e-mail should be zipped with the other submission requirements (contract, DRC/Financial Summary, POR text files) and attached to the opportunity record in SFDC. If an exception request is not approved, it may be possible to request an exception for sales crediting. Contact Sales Compensation or Sales Operations for information on how to request a sales crediting exception. Definition of “Contract” The contract should show that there is a valid, executable agreement in place - accepted by the client, with the Close Date, pricing currency, and contract term. Verbal orders, letters of intent, draft documents and memos of understanding are not acceptable forms of evidence of an arrangement. The following documents are acceptable for sales booking purposes: • Formal agreements (i.e. MPSA/MSA/Framework agreements, Services agreements, Consulting agreements, DXC license agreements) • SOWs • Work Orders, Task Orders, Service Orders, or similar documents • Change Requests or Amendments to existing contracts for new scope including pricing details (Copy of existing contracts if pricing details are missing in Change Requests or Amendments) • Evidence of online acceptance via DXC or client internal workflow systems Sales Booking accepts actual signatures of both parties or electronic/digital signatures. Whether or not actual signatures are available depends on the client, the documentation, and the process at the account.  If you are bundling multiple sales together in one opportunity record, at a minimum, provide one contract that represents the sales included in the bundle and reflects the Close Date selected in SFDC. Determine Reportability / Reportable Value For information on what is reportable, view the Bookings & Backlog Policy. The Policy provides guidance to determine: • If a sale is reportable and, • Reportable booking value The pursuit team follows the policy to determine reportable value. If there is a limitation on reporting and the financial model approved at Delegation of Authority (DOA) must be changed, Sales works with the person who provided financial model support to update the model.    Finalize the Opportunity Type Sales are categorized by type of sale. This tagging impacts not only sales booking but sales crediting and financial forecasts as well. Thus is it very important that sales are tagged with the correct opportunity type. Booking Validators verify the New Business sales. The Opportunity Type may also be referred to as “Sales Type” and “Deal Type”. Sales booking requirements for Renegotiations and IDIQ differ from other opportunity types (such as New Business, Up Sell). Double-click on the yellow bar to open the file which lists the definitions of each Opportunity Type.  opportunity_types. docx For definitions and guidance for the financial model, refer to the Financial Models - Economic and Reporting section Renegotiations require an additional financial model to help ensure that the Reporting and Economic cubes (databases) in in the data warehouse are accurate. IDIQ-Initial Submission – If the entire sale cannot be reported when it signs, the opportunity type in the financial model should not be IDIQ; it should be any other opportunity type (New Business, Up Sell, and so forth). For more direction, view the file attached above. Bundling Sales into one SFDC Opportunity Record Bundles in DXC will be combined prior to creating an Opportunity record in SFDC. The rules below should be followed when creating the Opportunity record. – Total Contract Value (TCV) of the bundle should not exceed 5M USD – TCV of each individual sale included in the bundle should not exceed 250K USD – All opportunities in each bundle must be with the same customer and contract – Bundles should not reflect multiple regions – Bundles should not include multiple Opportunity Types. Separate bundles should be submitted for New Logo, Cross Sell and so forth – There is no limit to the number of deals which can be included in one bundle – Bundles must reflect sales with close dates and revenue start date in the same fiscal quarter – Dates reflected in the bundle should be as follows: – The start date should be the earliest start date of the sales included in the bundle – The end date should be the latest end date of the sales included in the bundle – The sign date should be the latest sold date included in the bundle – There is no obligation to include a deal in a bundle and care should be taken that due to ABR calculation, inclusion in a bundle could reduce the reportable ABR (especially in cases where the deal with the latest sold date has a duration of 9 or more months). – Bundles need to be broken out by the Major Offering. WBS elements are assigned at the Major Offering level    Multi-term deals in Bundles can Adversely Impact ABR Calculation ~ Group Bundles Carefully Additional guidance:  Bundle sales on a monthly or quarterly basis. For example:  Bundle the April sales in one POR financial model and create an Opportunity Record in SFDC  Bundle the April through June sales together in one POR model and create an Opportunity Record in SFDC  Dates reflected in the bundle should be as follows:  The start date should be the earliest start date of the sales included in the bundle  The end date should be the latest end date of the sales included in the bundle  The close date should be the latest sold date included in the bundle. Financial Models – Economic and Reporting The financial model submitted for sales booking can also be referred to as the Plan of Record (POR) Model. Economic POR Model: The Economic Model is the model approved at governance and represents the most likely performance of the contract. The model is updated to reflect the signed contract, resulting in the Economic POR Model. The Economic Model reflects the values and dates in the signed contract, even if you are aware that there will be a delay in the start date. Reporting is based on the contract. Reporting POR Model: The Bookings & Backlog Policy is applied to the Economic POR Model, resulting in the Reporting POR Model. The Reporting POR Model reflects the contract’s revenue stream unless the reportable amount is limited by the Bookings & Backlog Policy. Typical limitations to reporting the full TCV include lack of minimum revenue or volume commitments, insufficient termination fees, optional services, or flexible contract term. This limitation generally results in IDIQ for the portion of the contract impacted by the policy. Revenue Recognition Review (deals supported by a Pricer) In conjunction with finalizing the model, the pricer reviews the model with the regional revenue recognition representative and obtains concurrence, if possible, before the POR model is submitted through the SFDC. If revenue recognition review results in a change to the POR model that was reported, a correction will be needed. Contact DXC Sales Booking for guidance.  Acceptable Financial Modeling Tools for Sales Booking  Xpress  E3T  Moby  PACE Beginning with all deals reported for 3QFY19, it is mandatory to provide a Deal Review Chart (P&L) and Plan of Record (POR) text files from a standard pricing tool in order to book a sale in SFDC irrespective of size. To obtain standard pricing tool access and training, go to the DXC Standard Pricing Tool Training SharePoint. Contact information is also available on the site. Understanding what was Previously Reported mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/dxcSalesBooking/SitePages/Home.aspx https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/dxcSalesBooking/SitePages/Home.aspx    Consideration must be given to whether the renewal/extension was included in the existing Economic POR Model when the sale was reported.  This typically is not the case unless an exception was granted at the time of reporting or the sale is USPS.  If the renewal/extension was included in the Economic POR Model, only the portion of the contract incremental to the previously reported Economic POR Model should be submitted for sales booking.  If there is no incremental impact to the Economic POR cube, no Economic POR text file should be submitted. Contact DXC Sales Booking to run a POR query to determine if the Economic and Reporting cubes in the financial data warehouse differ – if they are different, it may mean that the Economic data includes the renewal/extension. Additional Guidance – Renegotiation (“Early Renewal”) Because a renegotiation replaces all or part of an existing agreement, additional guidance is provided follows: The one key question to remember when determining what can be reported: “Is there an increase or decrease of revenue compared to the original POR (plus add-on) in any fiscal year for either the Economic or Reporting models?”  If there is no increase or decrease in revenue, the sale is not booked.  If there is an increase or decrease in revenue, then the increase or decrease is booked.   If there was a decrease in total revenue, the sale should be booked in SFDC; however, no TCV will be reported nor will the decrease be considered for regional TCV credit allocation. Note: Sign Date is based on the date of the Renegotiation, thus reported IYR reflects revenue for the renegotiation’s sign year netted against the original TCV plus add-on and is not based on or impacted by the original sign year. Renegotiations involving legacy CSC contracts – CSC did not load POR data to a central location. Thus there may not be an ‘original POR’ as referenced in this section. In this case, work with the finance team to obtain the financial forecast for the existing contract to be used in place of the original POR. Economic Model Reporting Model If the sale qualifies for booking, there are three Economic models created. 1. Economic POR Model - This is the Economic Model approved at governance updated to reflect the signed contract. This model reflects the Full Contract View and is the Economic POR model attached to the opportunity record in SFDC and loaded to the financial data warehouse. The model reflects the values and dates in the signed contract, even if you are aware that the will be a delay in the start date. Reporting is based on the contract. 2. Gross Reporting POR Model – This is the Economic POR Model adjusted for the Bookings & Backlog Policy. This model is not attached to the record in SFDC or loaded to the financial data warehouse; the model is used to create the Reporting POR Model (see section to the right). 3. “Zero-out” Economic model - This model is attached to the record in SFDC and loaded to the financial data warehouse. It will remove POR data from the data warehouse for the time period covered by the renegotiated contract. Once this model is loaded, the data warehouse will reflect only the current Renegotiated contract. Net difference between the Gross Reporting POR Model and the original Reporting POR (plus add-on) for the years, services, and scope covered in the new contract. This is the Reporting POR Model which reflects the Incremental Contract View and is the Reporting POR model attached to the record in SFDC and loaded to the data warehouse.  To create the Reporting POR Model:  Obtain the original Reporting POR plus add-on revenue and expense from DXC Sales Booking. Note that the currency in this data is USD.  Subtract the original Reporting POR plus add-on from the Gross Reporting POR Model. The Reporting POR Model is the basis for TCV reporting. Note: New POR Restatement process not available. DO NOT refer to old document. There is an annual POR Restatement process (legacy ES site) which allows Finance teams in the regions to adjust a contract’s POR in the data warehouse. It is possible that a mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com    To create the “zero-out” model:  Obtain the original Economic POR plus add-on revenue and expense from DXC Sales Booking. You can request the Economic POR data at the same time you request the Reporting POR data. Note that the currency in the POR is USD.  In Xpress, you will need to create an Opportunity since the Opportunity ID will be different (ID for the deal you are reporting+”BACK01”, see below example) and a Financial Model for that opportunity. Save the POR text file on your PC.  Create the model using these parameters:  Currency = USD  At a minimum, enter financial data by service line  Time Period = Same time period covered in the renegotiated contract  Enter values which are the opposite sign from the original POR plus add-on. For example, if August revenue in the original POR is $100, enter ($100) in Xpress’ financial model  Opportunity ID = Use this naming convention: Opportunity ID of the renegotiated contractBACK## where ## is a sequential number. For example, OPX-0000123456BACK01 POR Restatement is necessary prior to or in conjunction with reporting a Renegotiation. For example, the change in the FX rate of the currency in the original POR is such that the Reporting model is adversely impacted (very large negative IYR for example) and Management wants to restate the POR for this FX variance in conjunction with reporting the Renegotiation. The pursuit team would calculate the amount of the POR Restatement and work with Account Finance to ensure the POR Restatement is done, following the POR Restatement process, including approvals.  A Renegotiation can be reported prior to the POR Restatement. The “original Reporting POR (plus add-on)” from the data warehouse would be manually adjusted by the amount of the POR Restatement and then subtracted from the Gross Reporting POR Model as described above.  It is the responsibility of the Finance team to help ensure that the POR Restatement is done and loaded to the data warehouse; otherwise, the reported Renegotiation would not be accurate. In addition to FX fluctuations, there may have been significant changes to the contract and/or revenue estimate since the creation of the original POR. Since the intent is that contracts will NOT be penalized for historical under-performance, for purposes of determining Reportable TCV on contract renegotiations, the POR may be adjusted as is deemed reasonable by the contract’s financial support.  The following should be taken into consideration: 1. Historical performance for the past 18 months. Contract deterioration for only recent months or expected deterioration should NOT be used as a basis for adjustment. The account or industry financial teams should be able to provide the historical information. 2. Previously signed “contracts which decrease revenue. Any contracts signed within the past 12 months resulting in decreased revenue should be added to the POR estimate. This is to prevent reporting of TCV that has only recently been given up by the corporation. 3. Any adjustments made to the POR must be approved by the regional Finance Manager. The aforementioned POR Restatement Process may alleviate the need for this analysis. Additional Guidance – IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) Initial Contract Signing: Economic Model - The Economic Model typically includes an estimate for the IDIQ portion of the contract. Reporting Model - If the deal is 100% IDIQ, there is no Reporting POR Model submitted for the IDIQ portion of the contract at initial contract signing. If the deal is not 100% IDIQ, the Reporting POR Model reflected the amount that can be reported. mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com https://hpe.sharepoint.com/sites/B2/ES/Sales-NBF-Xpress/Pages/Home.aspx    When Reporting Actuals: Economic Model - Since the Economic POR Model should have included the IDIQ portion when the initial sale was booked, there would not be an Economic POR Model submitted when actuals are reported. Contact DXC Sales Booking to run a POR query to confirm that the Economic and Reporting cubes in the financial data warehouse differ – if they are different, it may mean that the Economic data includes the IDIQ Reporting Model - The Reporting POR Model reflects actuals and is reported on a quarterly or annual basis.  Contract Dates and Reportability All dates in the model are based on the signed contract. Even if you know that the contract start is delayed, the model should reflect the contract. A sale is reported in the quarter that the sale is certified & closed and validated. For example, if a contract signed in May but was not submitted until August, the TCV will be included in the 2nd quarter’s reported TCV since August is in the 2nd quarter. However, all attempts should be made to submit the sale in the quarter it was signed. If a contract close date is in the previous fiscal year:  The contract will be included in reported TCV if the sale is submitted during the first quarter of the next fiscal year. However, the TCV will not be included in the previous fiscal year’s reported TCV or be applied against the previous fiscal year’s targets. The reported TCV will impact the quarter in which the sale is submitted. For example, an FY17 signing certified & closed on April 10, 2017, will be included in first quarter FY18 reported TCV.  If the sale is certified & closed after the first quarter of the next fiscal year, the contract does not qualify for reporting - TCV will not be included in the reported TCV. However, if a contract does not qualify for reporting, the sale should STILL BE CERTIFIED & CLOSED for loading into the data warehouse to help facilitate the contract’s POR vs. actual analysis.  The POR Models can reflect a start date in the previous fiscal year and include previous fiscal year data. For example, if a contract signs in March and is reported in April, the start date can reflect March. If a contract close date is in the current fiscal year but the start date is in the previous fiscal year:  The POR Models can reflect a start date in the previous fiscal year and include previous fiscal year data. For example, if a contract signs in November 2015, the start date can reflect June 2015. It is possible that this situation could occur on a bundle, but typically the start date should be as of the close date or soon thereafter. Keep the following in mind in regards to dates:  Contract Start Date should always reflect the first month of the contract, which would include the interim agreement covering transition if transition begins before the contract is final. For booking IDIQ actuals, the Contract Start Date should reflect the first month of the period being reported. For example, if January - March is being reported, the Contract Start Date would be January.  Contract End Date should always reflect the last month of the contract. For IDIQ actuals, the Contract End Date should reflect the last month of the period being reported. For example, if January - March is being reported, the Contract End Date would be March. mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com     Contract Close Date should reflect the date of signature on the contract. Both parties (DXC and the client) must sign the agreement. If DXC and the client signed on different days, the latest date is the official close date. In the case of an automatic renewal, use the effective date of the automatic renewal. For IDIQ actuals, the Contract Sign Date should reflect the first month of the period being reported. For example, if January - March is being reported, the Contract Signed Date would be January.  For bundles, see the “bundling rules” section for direction. Exchange Rate Based on Budget Rate Conversion to USD in the financial model should be at the budget rate, which is set at the beginning of the fiscal year. The financial modeling tools should facilitate accurate conversion and SFDC reflects the budget rate. Certify & Close The tables on the following pages summarizes preparing and submitting the sale for booking. For instructions on the SFDC screens, view the Sales Booking training on the What We Sell Web site. Items of Note:  You must have DOA approvals and the submission requirements in place before you Certify & Close. You cannot make a few changes on the Certify & Close screen in one session, then return to complete the screen in a later session (there’s no ‘save as’ function).  The deal is marked “Won” (changed to Sales Stage 06) via the Certify & Close action. Thus you cannot mark a deal “Won” until you have completed DOA and have the submission requirements.  You can change the Close Date on the Certify & Close screen to an earlier date. So if you go into SFDC on May 5, you can select an April 30 close date on the Certify & Close screen. The close date you select on the Certify & Close screen will feed to the Close Date field on the Opportunity Detail screen.  Files attached on the Certify & Close screen appear in the Contract section of the opportunity record in SFDC.  If you have completed Certify & Close in SFDC but did not upload all of the submission requirements, you can upload files under the Notes & Attachments section of the record in SFDC when the deal is in Sales Stage 06 and the opportunity record is locked.  While files can be loaded to the DOA screens, please do not load sales booking information on those screens. DOA is a separate process and the opportunity record must reflect the artifacts used for booking in either the Contracts or Notes & Attachments section. Preparing and Booking the Sale Steps to take once the deal signs Submission Requirements Summary table Guidance for artifacts required to book a sale.  Preparing and Booking the Sale Opportunity Owner Booking Validator   Complete governance/DOA requirements Before a sale can be booked, all required DOA approvals must be recorded in SFDC. SFDC performs a final validation of the DOA process during the “Certify & Close” functionality. Thus the sale will not be booked if DOA is not complete. No action Finalize the contract with the customer, obtaining customer and DXC signatures -OR- You want to report monthly or quarterly IDIQ actuals Notify the person who prepared or will prepare the financial model (typically Sales/Operations if TCV < 5M USD; the Pricer if TCV > 5M USD) that the opportunity is sold and send them a copy of the entire contract, including signature page signed by both DXC and the client. The financial model is created/updated to reflect the signed contract prior. No action Determine the service lines that should be reflected in your deal Review the What We Sell Web site, ES Taxonomy Web site, and Master Offering Administrator SharePoint and discuss with your regional sales leader or Solutioning lead as necessary. The services being sold in the deal should be understood by the pursuit team and communicated to the entire team – the person updating SFDC and the cost model preparer must be in sync to ensure accuracy between SFDC and the POR model No action Determine if there is a difference between the Economic and Reporting POR Models The concept of “Economic” and “Reporting” models should be understood for all deals. See the Financial Models - Economic and Reporting section for details. Booking Validators would typically not know enough about the deal to help make this determination, but they should review the Bookings & Backlog Policy to be aware of the rules around reporting TCV Update SFDC to ensure that the opportunity reflects Reporting POR Model TCV by service line Since SFDC is the system of record for sales booking, it is very important that the financials and service offerings entered in SFDC is correct. For contract signings that do not have a reportable value because of the Bookings & Backlog Policy and thus is considered IDIQ, the financials should reflect $1 since there is no reportable value. When actuals are reported as they are delivered, the financials should reflect the booking values. Booking Validators will compare the financial model attached to the opportunity record in SFDC to the financials to verify accuracy. Certify & Close Assemble the required documents, viewing the Submission Requirements Summary in this document. Go to the Certify & Close button in SFDC to begin the booking process. For deals that close toward the end of the quarter, view the Process Calendar to ensure you are aware of the deadlines. Since manual data entry is required in SFDC, double-check the data to ensure accuracy. If you receive a reject request or a request for information from a Booking Validator, respond to the request within 1 working day. Return the submission for rework if the comments explaining the warning messages do not sufficiently explain the situation If there was an error in the submission If you find an error before the end of the quarter when the sale will be reported:  If the Booking Validation is not complete, contact the Booking Validator to inform them and open a case in SFDC to make updates to the opportunity record.  If Booking Validation is complete, follow the correction process. No action  Preparing and Booking the Sale Opportunity Owner Booking Validator    If the sale has been reported (the Decision Date field is populated with a quarter/fiscal year value), contact DXC Sales Booking for guidance. There will be a correction process that is not in place as of this writing. mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com Submission Requirement When Required Additional Direction    Contract Always required. If the contract cannot be attached to the opportunity record in SFDC, do not include the contract in the SFDC attachment. As of this writing, we are working through the requirements for validation of these types of sales. For now, work with the Booking Validators as best as possible to perform a review. “Contract” refers to a change order, purchase order, contract, or other documented agreement between the client and DXC See Definition of ""Contract"" section of this document for a detailed definition of Contract. The contract must reflect: 1. Client acceptance of DXC’s offer, and 2. Close Date If the contract includes different signature dates for the client and DXC, the latest close date is the close date that should be reflected in SFDC. If the contract does not contain the information above, attach artifacts to the opportunity record that support the close date as well as provides proof that the sale is valid. For an electronic agreement, such as an Aldea request, in lieu of signatures, proof is a screen print showing client acceptance or approval of request for services – should be clear who the client is and the close date. If these are not clear, document in a separate file and zip this file with the contract and attach to the opportunity record in SFDC. For a bundle of multiple sales into one opportunity record, you are not required to provide proof for each sale included in the bundle. Select at least one contract that is representative of the sale and reflects the Close Date entered into SFDC. This will allow the Close Date to be substantiated by a Booking Validator. P&L Always required The P&L must contain these fields at a minimum:  TCV  ABR (Validation team is responsible only to check if the overall ABR number is updated and the computation of ABR is valuated by pursuit team)  Total Account Operating Profit (total margin)  Total IYR For the Xpress and E3T financial modeling tools, you can submit the Deal Review Charts. For MOBY you can submit the Financial summary in PDF format. For PACE submit the Executive Financial Summary, If a Pricer created the financial model, include the email sent to you from the pricer with the P&L file attached in the zip attached in SFDC. POR Text Files Required if the Xpress ,E3T, Moby and PACE financial modeling tools were used View the Sales Booking Process slide deck and tool’s user guides for instructions on how to generate the POR text files. There are two files: Economic and Reporting. For a Renegotiation, there is a third POR text file: Zero-out Economic. See the Opportunity Types Definitions file attached above for direction. Submission Requirement When Required Additional Direction    Bookings & Backlog Policy exception If an exception to Policy was approved The format of the approval would be an e-mail; include this file in the attachment loaded to SFDC.    Booking Validation A team of Booking Validators reviews deals in SFDC with TCV > 100K USD. Deals that do not meet this criteria are auto-validated in SFDC immediately upon Certify & Close. Validation of the sale that is Certified & Closed in SFDC includes the following: What is Validated How is it Validated Submission Requirements are complete Check the contracts section of the opportunity record in SFDC to verify valid documents Total Contract Value (TCV) Check the P&L/Financial Summary with the values in SFDC Total of Account Operating Profit Check the P&L/Financial Summary with the values in SFDC Total Annual Booked Revenue (ABR) Check the P&L/Financial Summary with the values in SFDC However validation team is not responsible to valuate the ABR Total of In Year Revenue Check the P&L/Financial Summary with the values in SFDC Contract is valid and executable Review the contract copy in SFDC – signed or accepted by both DXC and the client Close Date matches SFDC Review the contract in SFDC – Should be the latest sign date in the contract if multiple signatures Currency reflected in the contract was used to enter the financials in SFDC Review the contract in SFDC – currency quoted; currency in SFDC Contract Term matches SFDC Review the Contract/ P&L/Financial Summary loaded into SFDC If Sales Type is New Logo, confirm that the sale meets the definition Check the Named Account List for FY19 deals and account name does not exist then it is a New Logo. Not required to check for FY20 deals.    POR existence - Xpress, E3T, Moby and PACE Check for POR existence in Xpress holding area to approve. Post E3T/Moby/PACE POR text files in Xpress server folder Additional quality checks can be performed as follows:  Review Opportunity Name for key words which may hint at inconsistency or inaccuracy  Does it mention “renegotiation” or “early renewal” but the Opportunity Type in SFDC is not Renewal or Defend?  “Actual” or “Delivered” may hint that the Opportunity Type should be IDIQ  “True-up” could mean they are reporting volume growth, which is not eligible for reporting unless the Opportunity Type is IDIQ  “Grouped Sales for QtrX” may indicate that the submission is a bundle. This will help you understand why revenue recognition may begin before the close date  Is the total margin negative and the Opportunity Type is not Renewal or Defend?  Contract term: Is the contract term 3 months and/or covers a quarter (Apr - Jun) (may be a sign they are reporting actuals on an IDIQ deal). If the Opportunity Type is not IDIQ, ask the Opportunity Owner if they are reporting actuals.  Is there a wide spread between close date and start date (> 6 Mo). Ask the Opportunity Owner why the large gap. Rejections in SFDC Booking Validators can reject the submission if they come across an issue during validation.  Finance Data Warehouse The following tasks are performed after Booking Validation to load the POR data to the finance data warehouse. Who: Validation team who has responsibility to perform the validation What: Validators will approve the POR text files in Xpress Holding Area or post the E3T/Moby/PACE POR files in the Xpress server folder to be picked up by the server.    During booking validation, validators will save the E3T/Moby/PACE POR text files attached in SFDC to their PC so they can be posted in Xpress server folder to be picked up by the server. Validators will approve the Xpress POR files in Xpress holding area. These are done only for deals which are >$100k. When: Daily - After validation is complete, go into Xpress holding area and approve the Xpress POR files or post the E3T/Moby/PACE POR files in Xpress server folder to be picked up by the server. Master Data The following tasks are performed to tag master data Client ID and Contract ID) to the sale or request Client IDs and/or Contract IDs, and set up the contract in the ERD financial system. Weekly - – Extract SFDC data – weekly “Sold” deals (SFDC Sales Stage 6) – Do mapping of Anaplan Extract with Template from SFDC Data – Update columns with data from extracts, confirm row formula copied to end of data list – Eliminate OPP ID already mapped (refer list maintained by Linda Dowlen) – Check for errors – Send completed OPP ID list to ERD DBM team for processing. – Where new Client or Contract IDs have been created, DBM team to send details to Region & Sales contacts listed – Linda Dowlen (ERD DBM) to send Sales Booking team updated OPP ID to Contract ID mapping list to be used for future submission cycles (Step 4, above) Correcting a Previously Reported Sale Or Validated Deal Scenarios for corrections • The financial values of a validated opportunity or previously reported deal were wrong (CR, and so forth), or • A duplicate sale was validated opportunity or previously reported (different Opportunity ID but same/similar Opportunity Name, financials), or • The non-financials of a validated opportunity or previously reported deal were wrong (opportunity type, service offering, and so forth), or • An opportunity which was validated opportunity or previously reported which turned out to be lost or not a ‘real’ sale Correcting a Previously Reported Sale To correct a previously reported sale in SFDC: Follow one of these, depending on the situation (see examples in the table):    a) If the financials were wrong, create a new Opportunity ID in SFDC for the change in financials so that when the previously booked sale is combined with the correction, the financials are correct. b) If the deal was a duplicate, the financial values should be opposite sign of the reported values c) If the correction does not impact financials, create two new Opportunity IDs in SFDC: i. Reversal of the reported opportunity with the same non-financial values, opposite sign financial values ii. Opportunity with corrected non-financial values and financials with the same values as reported • Enter the Reported Opportunity Name/IDs in the Related Opportunity field to illustrate the connection. This will facilitate identification of a correction in SFDC • Opportunity Name should include “Sales Booking Correction to OPX-nnn” where OPX-nnn is the reported Opportunity ID Example Table A reported or Validated Opportunity Name/ID should never been removed from SFDC. If it was a duplicate or was not reportable, a correction should be done.

The Sales Booking policy and process steps are followed by all organizations and regions within DXC. 100% of all opportunities in SFDC must go through the Sales Booking process in order for the sale to be reported and commissions paid. Sales Booking must follow standard rules and policy since sales data is critical to: • Administering the DXC Sales Incentive Plan, which involves sales quota attainment, calculation of bonus and commission payment for teams engaged in sales pursuit activities • Measuring actual revenue and costs against the forecast for quarterly and monthly Finance reviews, Key Performance Indicators (KPI) measurement • Setting up the contract (including invoicing and master data (Client ID, Contract ID) in the financial system(s) • Forecasting a contract’s expected financials (revenue, expense, margin) • Understanding what is being sold – services, types of sales, trends • Measuring success and improving processes when sales booking data is the data used to build analysis Sales, Account teams and Finance teams are involved in processing sales (Certify & Close, validating). Groups that use sales booking data includes Sales Compensation, Sales Operations, Sales Finance, Finance Account Management, Revenue Management (finance), the Practices organization and DXC Finance Operations. Sales should be submitted in the month that they occur. The service level (SLA) for submissions is 15 days from contract signature. The peak time for sales booking is the last three weeks of the quarter; typically 50-60% of reported sales are submitted for validation during this time. Teams should strive to report sales as soon as they occur to ensure their sales can be reported in the quarter that they signed. If the sale is not validated by the “Final Sales Booking Validation Date” per the Sales Booking Process Calendar, the sale will not be included in that period’s reported new sales, but will be included in the next period’s reported sales. The DXC Sales Booking Web site contains sales booking process documentation.  https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseFinancialReporting/SalesBooking/SitePages/Home.aspx    Process Flow / Responsibilities  Training, Documentation, Contacts Sales booking training related to SFDC functionality is available on the What We Sell Web site (from the myDXC Web site, select the What We Sell link on the right side of the page).       All users can access the sales booking documentation on the DXC Sales Booking Web site. If you have questions, send an email to DXC Sales Booking (arch.communications@dxc.com). Process Duration  https://my.dxc.com/ https://my.dxc.com/ https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseFinancialReporting/SalesBooking/SitePages/Home.aspx mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com    The guidance below is per the legacy ES process. Process duration goals: 1. Have transactions approved on average within 16 workdays from the contract sold date. 2. Report nearly all transactions in the quarter when it was sold. The sales booking process follows a sequence with short timeframes.  The expected duration from Contract signature to Certify & Close is 0 to 15 workdays from date of sale or prior end of quarter.  The expected duration from Certify & Close to Booking Validation Complete is 0 to 1 workday. Transactions with TCV < 100 are system-approved and require no active approvals from Finance. The final reporting of transactions occurs quarterly. Once a quarter is reported, no changes to reported transactions can occur. If a changed to a reported sale is necessary, a correction is submitted. The correction process is in place. Do not sacrifice quality for time – while we are measuring against the sales booking duration targets, an accurate Plan of Record (POR) is extremely important. Do it right the first time – make sure the POR data is correct prior to Certify & Close. Process Calendar Sales Booking Connection to other Processes Sales team activities that will impact Sales Booking - by Sales Stage: Sales Stage Sales Team Activities that Impact Sales Booking 1 Enter opportunity in Salesforce.com (SFDC) (creates an Opportunity ID)    1 Determine if opportunity type = New Business 4 Finalize Opportunity Type 4/5 Determine service offering families reflected in the financial model 4/5 Consider what is reportable (using the DXC Bookings & Backlog Policy) 5 Prepare for Certify & Close (understand submission requirements, complete DOA) 6 Certify & Close in SFDC Sales Compensation / Sales Crediting For sales crediting to apply to a sale, the booking must be validated in SFDC. Sales Crediting should be based on the booked/reported value. Contact Sales Compensation or Sales Operations for process details. Master Data 1. Extract SFDC data – weekly “Sold” deals (SFDC Sales Stage 6) 2. Do mapping of Anaplan Extract with Template from SFDC Data 3. Update columns with data from extracts, confirm row formula copied to end of data list 4. Eliminate OPP ID already mapped (refer list maintained by Linda Dowlen) 5. Check for errors 6. Send completed OPP ID list to ERD DBM team for processing. 7. Where new Client or Contract IDs have been created, DBM team to send details to Region & Sales contacts listed 8. Linda Dowlen (ERD DBM) to send Sales Booking team updated OPP ID to Contract ID mapping list to be used for future submission cycles (Step 4, above)  Financial Forecasting Once a deal signs, POR data from Sales Booking should be the basis for the financial forecast in the ALM system. Before contract signing, pursuit data from SFDC is typically used in the forecast. When the source of the forecast is Sales Booking, if those who prepare the forecast think that there are inaccuracies with the POR data – dates, financial values, Opportunity Type, and so forth – the “forecaster” should send an email to DXC Sales Booking. An Administrator will provide Opportunity Owner and Cost Model Preparer information (preparer info is reflected in the POR text file) to the forecaster so that they can discuss what they are seeing. If a booked sale is inaccurate, it can be updated or corrected, depending on where it is in the process.  mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com    Evaluate Exceptions to Bookings & Backlog Policy Approval requirements for exceptions is stated in the policy.  All approved policy exceptions should be documented in e-mail. The e-mail should be zipped with the other submission requirements (contract, DRC/Financial Summary, POR text files) and attached to the opportunity record in SFDC. If an exception request is not approved, it may be possible to request an exception for sales crediting. Contact Sales Compensation or Sales Operations for information on how to request a sales crediting exception. Definition of “Contract” The contract should show that there is a valid, executable agreement in place - accepted by the client, with the Close Date, pricing currency, and contract term. Verbal orders, letters of intent, draft documents and memos of understanding are not acceptable forms of evidence of an arrangement. The following documents are acceptable for sales booking purposes: • Formal agreements (i.e. MPSA/MSA/Framework agreements, Services agreements, Consulting agreements, DXC license agreements) • SOWs • Work Orders, Task Orders, Service Orders, or similar documents • Change Requests or Amendments to existing contracts for new scope including pricing details (Copy of existing contracts if pricing details are missing in Change Requests or Amendments) • Evidence of online acceptance via DXC or client internal workflow systems Sales Booking accepts actual signatures of both parties or electronic/digital signatures. Whether or not actual signatures are available depends on the client, the documentation, and the process at the account.  If you are bundling multiple sales together in one opportunity record, at a minimum, provide one contract that represents the sales included in the bundle and reflects the Close Date selected in SFDC. Determine Reportability / Reportable Value For information on what is reportable, view the Bookings & Backlog Policy. The Policy provides guidance to determine: • If a sale is reportable and, • Reportable booking value The pursuit team follows the policy to determine reportable value. If there is a limitation on reporting and the financial model approved at Delegation of Authority (DOA) must be changed, Sales works with the person who provided financial model support to update the model.    Finalize the Opportunity Type Sales are categorized by type of sale. This tagging impacts not only sales booking but sales crediting and financial forecasts as well. Thus is it very important that sales are tagged with the correct opportunity type. Booking Validators verify the New Business sales. The Opportunity Type may also be referred to as “Sales Type” and “Deal Type”. Sales booking requirements for Renegotiations and IDIQ differ from other opportunity types (such as New Business, Up Sell). Double-click on the yellow bar to open the file which lists the definitions of each Opportunity Type.  opportunity_types. docx For definitions and guidance for the financial model, refer to the Financial Models - Economic and Reporting section Renegotiations require an additional financial model to help ensure that the Reporting and Economic cubes (databases) in in the data warehouse are accurate. IDIQ-Initial Submission – If the entire sale cannot be reported when it signs, the opportunity type in the financial model should not be IDIQ; it should be any other opportunity type (New Business, Up Sell, and so forth). For more direction, view the file attached above. Bundling Sales into one SFDC Opportunity Record Bundles in DXC will be combined prior to creating an Opportunity record in SFDC. The rules below should be followed when creating the Opportunity record. – Total Contract Value (TCV) of the bundle should not exceed 5M USD – TCV of each individual sale included in the bundle should not exceed 250K USD – All opportunities in each bundle must be with the same customer and contract – Bundles should not reflect multiple regions – Bundles should not include multiple Opportunity Types. Separate bundles should be submitted for New Logo, Cross Sell and so forth – There is no limit to the number of deals which can be included in one bundle – Bundles must reflect sales with close dates and revenue start date in the same fiscal quarter – Dates reflected in the bundle should be as follows: – The start date should be the earliest start date of the sales included in the bundle – The end date should be the latest end date of the sales included in the bundle – The sign date should be the latest sold date included in the bundle – There is no obligation to include a deal in a bundle and care should be taken that due to ABR calculation, inclusion in a bundle could reduce the reportable ABR (especially in cases where the deal with the latest sold date has a duration of 9 or more months). – Bundles need to be broken out by the Major Offering. WBS elements are assigned at the Major Offering level    Multi-term deals in Bundles can Adversely Impact ABR Calculation ~ Group Bundles Carefully Additional guidance:  Bundle sales on a monthly or quarterly basis. For example:  Bundle the April sales in one POR financial model and create an Opportunity Record in SFDC  Bundle the April through June sales together in one POR model and create an Opportunity Record in SFDC  Dates reflected in the bundle should be as follows:  The start date should be the earliest start date of the sales included in the bundle  The end date should be the latest end date of the sales included in the bundle  The close date should be the latest sold date included in the bundle. Financial Models – Economic and Reporting The financial model submitted for sales booking can also be referred to as the Plan of Record (POR) Model. Economic POR Model: The Economic Model is the model approved at governance and represents the most likely performance of the contract. The model is updated to reflect the signed contract, resulting in the Economic POR Model. The Economic Model reflects the values and dates in the signed contract, even if you are aware that there will be a delay in the start date. Reporting is based on the contract. Reporting POR Model: The Bookings & Backlog Policy is applied to the Economic POR Model, resulting in the Reporting POR Model. The Reporting POR Model reflects the contract’s revenue stream unless the reportable amount is limited by the Bookings & Backlog Policy. Typical limitations to reporting the full TCV include lack of minimum revenue or volume commitments, insufficient termination fees, optional services, or flexible contract term. This limitation generally results in IDIQ for the portion of the contract impacted by the policy. Revenue Recognition Review (deals supported by a Pricer) In conjunction with finalizing the model, the pricer reviews the model with the regional revenue recognition representative and obtains concurrence, if possible, before the POR model is submitted through the SFDC. If revenue recognition review results in a change to the POR model that was reported, a correction will be needed. Contact DXC Sales Booking for guidance.  Acceptable Financial Modeling Tools for Sales Booking  Xpress  E3T  Moby  PACE Beginning with all deals reported for 3QFY19, it is mandatory to provide a Deal Review Chart (P&L) and Plan of Record (POR) text files from a standard pricing tool in order to book a sale in SFDC irrespective of size. To obtain standard pricing tool access and training, go to the DXC Standard Pricing Tool Training SharePoint. Contact information is also available on the site. Understanding what was Previously Reported mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/dxcSalesBooking/SitePages/Home.aspx https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/dxcSalesBooking/SitePages/Home.aspx    Consideration must be given to whether the renewal/extension was included in the existing Economic POR Model when the sale was reported.  This typically is not the case unless an exception was granted at the time of reporting or the sale is USPS.  If the renewal/extension was included in the Economic POR Model, only the portion of the contract incremental to the previously reported Economic POR Model should be submitted for sales booking.  If there is no incremental impact to the Economic POR cube, no Economic POR text file should be submitted. Contact DXC Sales Booking to run a POR query to determine if the Economic and Reporting cubes in the financial data warehouse differ – if they are different, it may mean that the Economic data includes the renewal/extension. Additional Guidance – Renegotiation (“Early Renewal”) Because a renegotiation replaces all or part of an existing agreement, additional guidance is provided follows: The one key question to remember when determining what can be reported: “Is there an increase or decrease of revenue compared to the original POR (plus add-on) in any fiscal year for either the Economic or Reporting models?”  If there is no increase or decrease in revenue, the sale is not booked.  If there is an increase or decrease in revenue, then the increase or decrease is booked.   If there was a decrease in total revenue, the sale should be booked in SFDC; however, no TCV will be reported nor will the decrease be considered for regional TCV credit allocation. Note: Sign Date is based on the date of the Renegotiation, thus reported IYR reflects revenue for the renegotiation’s sign year netted against the original TCV plus add-on and is not based on or impacted by the original sign year. Renegotiations involving legacy CSC contracts – CSC did not load POR data to a central location. Thus there may not be an ‘original POR’ as referenced in this section. In this case, work with the finance team to obtain the financial forecast for the existing contract to be used in place of the original POR. Economic Model Reporting Model If the sale qualifies for booking, there are three Economic models created. 1. Economic POR Model - This is the Economic Model approved at governance updated to reflect the signed contract. This model reflects the Full Contract View and is the Economic POR model attached to the opportunity record in SFDC and loaded to the financial data warehouse. The model reflects the values and dates in the signed contract, even if you are aware that the will be a delay in the start date. Reporting is based on the contract. 2. Gross Reporting POR Model – This is the Economic POR Model adjusted for the Bookings & Backlog Policy. This model is not attached to the record in SFDC or loaded to the financial data warehouse; the model is used to create the Reporting POR Model (see section to the right). 3. “Zero-out” Economic model - This model is attached to the record in SFDC and loaded to the financial data warehouse. It will remove POR data from the data warehouse for the time period covered by the renegotiated contract. Once this model is loaded, the data warehouse will reflect only the current Renegotiated contract. Net difference between the Gross Reporting POR Model and the original Reporting POR (plus add-on) for the years, services, and scope covered in the new contract. This is the Reporting POR Model which reflects the Incremental Contract View and is the Reporting POR model attached to the record in SFDC and loaded to the data warehouse.  To create the Reporting POR Model:  Obtain the original Reporting POR plus add-on revenue and expense from DXC Sales Booking. Note that the currency in this data is USD.  Subtract the original Reporting POR plus add-on from the Gross Reporting POR Model. The Reporting POR Model is the basis for TCV reporting. Note: New POR Restatement process not available. DO NOT refer to old document. There is an annual POR Restatement process (legacy ES site) which allows Finance teams in the regions to adjust a contract’s POR in the data warehouse. It is possible that a mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com    To create the “zero-out” model:  Obtain the original Economic POR plus add-on revenue and expense from DXC Sales Booking. You can request the Economic POR data at the same time you request the Reporting POR data. Note that the currency in the POR is USD.  In Xpress, you will need to create an Opportunity since the Opportunity ID will be different (ID for the deal you are reporting+”BACK01”, see below example) and a Financial Model for that opportunity. Save the POR text file on your PC.  Create the model using these parameters:  Currency = USD  At a minimum, enter financial data by service line  Time Period = Same time period covered in the renegotiated contract  Enter values which are the opposite sign from the original POR plus add-on. For example, if August revenue in the original POR is $100, enter ($100) in Xpress’ financial model  Opportunity ID = Use this naming convention: Opportunity ID of the renegotiated contractBACK## where ## is a sequential number. For example, OPX-0000123456BACK01 POR Restatement is necessary prior to or in conjunction with reporting a Renegotiation. For example, the change in the FX rate of the currency in the original POR is such that the Reporting model is adversely impacted (very large negative IYR for example) and Management wants to restate the POR for this FX variance in conjunction with reporting the Renegotiation. The pursuit team would calculate the amount of the POR Restatement and work with Account Finance to ensure the POR Restatement is done, following the POR Restatement process, including approvals.  A Renegotiation can be reported prior to the POR Restatement. The “original Reporting POR (plus add-on)” from the data warehouse would be manually adjusted by the amount of the POR Restatement and then subtracted from the Gross Reporting POR Model as described above.  It is the responsibility of the Finance team to help ensure that the POR Restatement is done and loaded to the data warehouse; otherwise, the reported Renegotiation would not be accurate. In addition to FX fluctuations, there may have been significant changes to the contract and/or revenue estimate since the creation of the original POR. Since the intent is that contracts will NOT be penalized for historical under-performance, for purposes of determining Reportable TCV on contract renegotiations, the POR may be adjusted as is deemed reasonable by the contract’s financial support.  The following should be taken into consideration: 1. Historical performance for the past 18 months. Contract deterioration for only recent months or expected deterioration should NOT be used as a basis for adjustment. The account or industry financial teams should be able to provide the historical information. 2. Previously signed “contracts which decrease revenue. Any contracts signed within the past 12 months resulting in decreased revenue should be added to the POR estimate. This is to prevent reporting of TCV that has only recently been given up by the corporation. 3. Any adjustments made to the POR must be approved by the regional Finance Manager. The aforementioned POR Restatement Process may alleviate the need for this analysis. Additional Guidance – IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) Initial Contract Signing: Economic Model - The Economic Model typically includes an estimate for the IDIQ portion of the contract. Reporting Model - If the deal is 100% IDIQ, there is no Reporting POR Model submitted for the IDIQ portion of the contract at initial contract signing. If the deal is not 100% IDIQ, the Reporting POR Model reflected the amount that can be reported. mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com https://hpe.sharepoint.com/sites/B2/ES/Sales-NBF-Xpress/Pages/Home.aspx    When Reporting Actuals: Economic Model - Since the Economic POR Model should have included the IDIQ portion when the initial sale was booked, there would not be an Economic POR Model submitted when actuals are reported. Contact DXC Sales Booking to run a POR query to confirm that the Economic and Reporting cubes in the financial data warehouse differ – if they are different, it may mean that the Economic data includes the IDIQ Reporting Model - The Reporting POR Model reflects actuals and is reported on a quarterly or annual basis.  Contract Dates and Reportability All dates in the model are based on the signed contract. Even if you know that the contract start is delayed, the model should reflect the contract. A sale is reported in the quarter that the sale is certified & closed and validated. For example, if a contract signed in May but was not submitted until August, the TCV will be included in the 2nd quarter’s reported TCV since August is in the 2nd quarter. However, all attempts should be made to submit the sale in the quarter it was signed. If a contract close date is in the previous fiscal year:  The contract will be included in reported TCV if the sale is submitted during the first quarter of the next fiscal year. However, the TCV will not be included in the previous fiscal year’s reported TCV or be applied against the previous fiscal year’s targets. The reported TCV will impact the quarter in which the sale is submitted. For example, an FY17 signing certified & closed on April 10, 2017, will be included in first quarter FY18 reported TCV.  If the sale is certified & closed after the first quarter of the next fiscal year, the contract does not qualify for reporting - TCV will not be included in the reported TCV. However, if a contract does not qualify for reporting, the sale should STILL BE CERTIFIED & CLOSED for loading into the data warehouse to help facilitate the contract’s POR vs. actual analysis.  The POR Models can reflect a start date in the previous fiscal year and include previous fiscal year data. For example, if a contract signs in March and is reported in April, the start date can reflect March. If a contract close date is in the current fiscal year but the start date is in the previous fiscal year:  The POR Models can reflect a start date in the previous fiscal year and include previous fiscal year data. For example, if a contract signs in November 2015, the start date can reflect June 2015. It is possible that this situation could occur on a bundle, but typically the start date should be as of the close date or soon thereafter. Keep the following in mind in regards to dates:  Contract Start Date should always reflect the first month of the contract, which would include the interim agreement covering transition if transition begins before the contract is final. For booking IDIQ actuals, the Contract Start Date should reflect the first month of the period being reported. For example, if January - March is being reported, the Contract Start Date would be January.  Contract End Date should always reflect the last month of the contract. For IDIQ actuals, the Contract End Date should reflect the last month of the period being reported. For example, if January - March is being reported, the Contract End Date would be March. mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com mailto:arch.communications@hpe.com     Contract Close Date should reflect the date of signature on the contract. Both parties (DXC and the client) must sign the agreement. If DXC and the client signed on different days, the latest date is the official close date. In the case of an automatic renewal, use the effective date of the automatic renewal. For IDIQ actuals, the Contract Sign Date should reflect the first month of the period being reported. For example, if January - March is being reported, the Contract Signed Date would be January.  For bundles, see the “bundling rules” section for direction. Exchange Rate Based on Budget Rate Conversion to USD in the financial model should be at the budget rate, which is set at the beginning of the fiscal year. The financial modeling tools should facilitate accurate conversion and SFDC reflects the budget rate. Certify & Close The tables on the following pages summarizes preparing and submitting the sale for booking. For instructions on the SFDC screens, view the Sales Booking training on the What We Sell Web site. Items of Note:  You must have DOA approvals and the submission requirements in place before you Certify & Close. You cannot make a few changes on the Certify & Close screen in one session, then return to complete the screen in a later session (there’s no ‘save as’ function).  The deal is marked “Won” (changed to Sales Stage 06) via the Certify & Close action. Thus you cannot mark a deal “Won” until you have completed DOA and have the submission requirements.  You can change the Close Date on the Certify & Close screen to an earlier date. So if you go into SFDC on May 5, you can select an April 30 close date on the Certify & Close screen. The close date you select on the Certify & Close screen will feed to the Close Date field on the Opportunity Detail screen.  Files attached on the Certify & Close screen appear in the Contract section of the opportunity record in SFDC.  If you have completed Certify & Close in SFDC but did not upload all of the submission requirements, you can upload files under the Notes & Attachments section of the record in SFDC when the deal is in Sales Stage 06 and the opportunity record is locked.  While files can be loaded to the DOA screens, please do not load sales booking information on those screens. DOA is a separate process and the opportunity record must reflect the artifacts used for booking in either the Contracts or Notes & Attachments section. Preparing and Booking the Sale Steps to take once the deal signs Submission Requirements Summary table Guidance for artifacts required to book a sale.  Preparing and Booking the Sale Opportunity Owner Booking Validator   Complete governance/DOA requirements Before a sale can be booked, all required DOA approvals must be recorded in SFDC. SFDC performs a final validation of the DOA process during the “Certify & Close” functionality. Thus the sale will not be booked if DOA is not complete. No action Finalize the contract with the customer, obtaining customer and DXC signatures -OR- You want to report monthly or quarterly IDIQ actuals Notify the person who prepared or will prepare the financial model (typically Sales/Operations if TCV < 5M USD; the Pricer if TCV > 5M USD) that the opportunity is sold and send them a copy of the entire contract, including signature page signed by both DXC and the client. The financial model is created/updated to reflect the signed contract prior. No action Determine the service lines that should be reflected in your deal Review the What We Sell Web site, ES Taxonomy Web site, and Master Offering Administrator SharePoint and discuss with your regional sales leader or Solutioning lead as necessary. The services being sold in the deal should be understood by the pursuit team and communicated to the entire team – the person updating SFDC and the cost model preparer must be in sync to ensure accuracy between SFDC and the POR model No action Determine if there is a difference between the Economic and Reporting POR Models The concept of “Economic” and “Reporting” models should be understood for all deals. See the Financial Models - Economic and Reporting section for details. Booking Validators would typically not know enough about the deal to help make this determination, but they should review the Bookings & Backlog Policy to be aware of the rules around reporting TCV Update SFDC to ensure that the opportunity reflects Reporting POR Model TCV by service line Since SFDC is the system of record for sales booking, it is very important that the financials and service offerings entered in SFDC is correct. For contract signings that do not have a reportable value because of the Bookings & Backlog Policy and thus is considered IDIQ, the financials should reflect $1 since there is no reportable value. When actuals are reported as they are delivered, the financials should reflect the booking values. Booking Validators will compare the financial model attached to the opportunity record in SFDC to the financials to verify accuracy. Certify & Close Assemble the required documents, viewing the Submission Requirements Summary in this document. Go to the Certify & Close button in SFDC to begin the booking process. For deals that close toward the end of the quarter, view the Process Calendar to ensure you are aware of the deadlines. Since manual data entry is required in SFDC, double-check the data to ensure accuracy. If you receive a reject request or a request for information from a Booking Validator, respond to the request within 1 working day. Return the submission for rework if the comments explaining the warning messages do not sufficiently explain the situation If there was an error in the submission If you find an error before the end of the quarter when the sale will be reported:  If the Booking Validation is not complete, contact the Booking Validator to inform them and open a case in SFDC to make updates to the opportunity record.  If Booking Validation is complete, follow the correction process. No action  Preparing and Booking the Sale Opportunity Owner Booking Validator    If the sale has been reported (the Decision Date field is populated with a quarter/fiscal year value), contact DXC Sales Booking for guidance. There will be a correction process that is not in place as of this writing. mailto:arch.communications@dxc.com Submission Requirement When Required Additional Direction    Contract Always required. If the contract cannot be attached to the opportunity record in SFDC, do not include the contract in the SFDC attachment. As of this writing, we are working through the requirements for validation of these types of sales. For now, work with the Booking Validators as best as possible to perform a review. “Contract” refers to a change order, purchase order, contract, or other documented agreement between the client and DXC See Definition of ""Contract"" section of this document for a detailed definition of Contract. The contract must reflect: 1. Client acceptance of DXC’s offer, and 2. Close Date If the contract includes different signature dates for the client and DXC, the latest close date is the close date that should be reflected in SFDC. If the contract does not contain the information above, attach artifacts to the opportunity record that support the close date as well as provides proof that the sale is valid. For an electronic agreement, such as an Aldea request, in lieu of signatures, proof is a screen print showing client acceptance or approval of request for services – should be clear who the client is and the close date. If these are not clear, document in a separate file and zip this file with the contract and attach to the opportunity record in SFDC. For a bundle of multiple sales into one opportunity record, you are not required to provide proof for each sale included in the bundle. Select at least one contract that is representative of the sale and reflects the Close Date entered into SFDC. This will allow the Close Date to be substantiated by a Booking Validator. P&L Always required The P&L must contain these fields at a minimum:  TCV  ABR (Validation team is responsible only to check if the overall ABR number is updated and the computation of ABR is valuated by pursuit team)  Total Account Operating Profit (total margin)  Total IYR For the Xpress and E3T financial modeling tools, you can submit the Deal Review Charts. For MOBY you can submit the Financial summary in PDF format. For PACE submit the Executive Financial Summary, If a Pricer created the financial model, include the email sent to you from the pricer with the P&L file attached in the zip attached in SFDC. POR Text Files Required if the Xpress ,E3T, Moby and PACE financial modeling tools were used View the Sales Booking Process slide deck and tool’s user guides for instructions on how to generate the POR text files. There are two files: Economic and Reporting. For a Renegotiation, there is a third POR text file: Zero-out Economic. See the Opportunity Types Definitions file attached above for direction. Submission Requirement When Required Additional Direction    Bookings & Backlog Policy exception If an exception to Policy was approved The format of the approval would be an e-mail; include this file in the attachment loaded to SFDC.    Booking Validation A team of Booking Validators reviews deals in SFDC with TCV > 100K USD. Deals that do not meet this criteria are auto-validated in SFDC immediately upon Certify & Close. Validation of the sale that is Certified & Closed in SFDC includes the following: What is Validated How is it Validated Submission Requirements are complete Check the contracts section of the opportunity record in SFDC to verify valid documents Total Contract Value (TCV) Check the P&L/Financial Summary with the values in SFDC Total of Account Operating Profit Check the P&L/Financial Summary with the values in SFDC Total Annual Booked Revenue (ABR) Check the P&L/Financial Summary with the values in SFDC However validation team is not responsible to valuate the ABR Total of In Year Revenue Check the P&L/Financial Summary with the values in SFDC Contract is valid and executable Review the contract copy in SFDC – signed or accepted by both DXC and the client Close Date matches SFDC Review the contract in SFDC – Should be the latest sign date in the contract if multiple signatures Currency reflected in the contract was used to enter the financials in SFDC Review the contract in SFDC – currency quoted; currency in SFDC Contract Term matches SFDC Review the Contract/ P&L/Financial Summary loaded into SFDC If Sales Type is New Logo, confirm that the sale meets the definition Check the Named Account List for FY19 deals and account name does not exist then it is a New Logo. Not required to check for FY20 deals.    POR existence - Xpress, E3T, Moby and PACE Check for POR existence in Xpress holding area to approve. Post E3T/Moby/PACE POR text files in Xpress server folder Additional quality checks can be performed as follows:  Review Opportunity Name for key words which may hint at inconsistency or inaccuracy  Does it mention “renegotiation” or “early renewal” but the Opportunity Type in SFDC is not Renewal or Defend?  “Actual” or “Delivered” may hint that the Opportunity Type should be IDIQ  “True-up” could mean they are reporting volume growth, which is not eligible for reporting unless the Opportunity Type is IDIQ  “Grouped Sales for QtrX” may indicate that the submission is a bundle. This will help you understand why revenue recognition may begin before the close date  Is the total margin negative and the Opportunity Type is not Renewal or Defend?  Contract term: Is the contract term 3 months and/or covers a quarter (Apr - Jun) (may be a sign they are reporting actuals on an IDIQ deal). If the Opportunity Type is not IDIQ, ask the Opportunity Owner if they are reporting actuals.  Is there a wide spread between close date and start date (> 6 Mo). Ask the Opportunity Owner why the large gap. Rejections in SFDC Booking Validators can reject the submission if they come across an issue during validation.  Finance Data Warehouse The following tasks are performed after Booking Validation to load the POR data to the finance data warehouse. Who: Validation team who has responsibility to perform the validation What: Validators will approve the POR text files in Xpress Holding Area or post the E3T/Moby/PACE POR files in the Xpress server folder to be picked up by the server.    During booking validation, validators will save the E3T/Moby/PACE POR text files attached in SFDC to their PC so they can be posted in Xpress server folder to be picked up by the server. Validators will approve the Xpress POR files in Xpress holding area. These are done only for deals which are >$100k. When: Daily - After validation is complete, go into Xpress holding area and approve the Xpress POR files or post the E3T/Moby/PACE POR files in Xpress server folder to be picked up by the server. Master Data The following tasks are performed to tag master data Client ID and Contract ID) to the sale or request Client IDs and/or Contract IDs, and set up the contract in the ERD financial system. Weekly - – Extract SFDC data – weekly “Sold” deals (SFDC Sales Stage 6) – Do mapping of Anaplan Extract with Template from SFDC Data – Update columns with data from extracts, confirm row formula copied to end of data list – Eliminate OPP ID already mapped (refer list maintained by Linda Dowlen) – Check for errors – Send completed OPP ID list to ERD DBM team for processing. – Where new Client or Contract IDs have been created, DBM team to send details to Region & Sales contacts listed – Linda Dowlen (ERD DBM) to send Sales Booking team updated OPP ID to Contract ID mapping list to be used for future submission cycles (Step 4, above) Correcting a Previously Reported Sale Or Validated Deal Scenarios for corrections • The financial values of a validated opportunity or previously reported deal were wrong (CR, and so forth), or • A duplicate sale was validated opportunity or previously reported (different Opportunity ID but same/similar Opportunity Name, financials), or • The non-financials of a validated opportunity or previously reported deal were wrong (opportunity type, service offering, and so forth), or • An opportunity which was validated opportunity or previously reported which turned out to be lost or not a ‘real’ sale Correcting a Previously Reported Sale To correct a previously reported sale in SFDC: Follow one of these, depending on the situation (see examples in the table):    a) If the financials were wrong, create a new Opportunity ID in SFDC for the change in financials so that when the previously booked sale is combined with the correction, the financials are correct. b) If the deal was a duplicate, the financial values should be opposite sign of the reported values c) If the correction does not impact financials, create two new Opportunity IDs in SFDC: i. Reversal of the reported opportunity with the same non-financial values, opposite sign financial values ii. Opportunity with corrected non-financial values and financials with the same values as reported • Enter the Reported Opportunity Name/IDs in the Related Opportunity field to illustrate the connection.

Because many inquiries require a more tailored response, we recommend that you use this as a guideline to begin and then email CR@dxc.com or further information and support.  GENERAL CR Policies o DXC currently has several CR-related policies, including Responsible Procurement, Modern Slavery, Environmental Health & Safety and Human Rights o They can be found here LINK o Gender Pay Gap Statement (UK) LINK General CR Program Information o The best source for information on our CR program is our annual CR Report and latest GRI submission which can be found here LINK  o For more information or a more tailored response to this area, email CR@dxc.com  Does your organisation have a commitment to improving its sustainability performance? o DXC has undertaken a detailed materiality analysis that has helped us to define our key CR objectives. It is our goal to establish DXC as a responsible and sustainable company that parallels the quality of our IT and business services reputation, supports our clients in their own sustainability objectives, and achieves triple bottom-line benefits from sustainable best practice. o In the short term, DXC’s CR strategy will focus on reporting, energy efficiency, energy management standards, and identifying where we can help our clients meet their own carbon goals. To win new business, we must be able to provide responses to new business requests that articulate solutions that will support our clients and show environmental and social progress. We have identified “quick win” initiatives to save energy and have communicated these internally. o Mid- and longer term, with energy efficiency being part of DXC’s overall IT strategy, we continue to focus on data center technology and business process design in the areas of data center planning and management, energy and emissions measurement and reporting, and industry/peer benchmarking. In the areas of systems implementation and integration, we continue to offer and expand services in server virtualization and consolidation, cloud computing, storage consolidation, data center consolidation, and green data center certification. We will align this approach with the global rollout of ISO 50001 and upskilling of data center personnel. mailto:CR@dxc.com http://www.dxc.technology/cr/ds/82786-our_corporate_responsibility_policies_and_principles https://www.dxc.technology/uki/ds/11507/146310-dxc_technology_gender_pay_gap_report https://www.dxc.technology/cr/flxwd/145370-corporate_responsibility_and_sustainability_report CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 3 o We have a DXC Foundation, a registered 501(c)(3) charity in the United States, to provide structure to our philanthropic activities, aligning our giving with our mission and values. The Foundation invests in community-based, employee-led programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), to help young people engage with technology, address the digital skills gap, and provide a future pipeline of talent. Global Environmental Targets DXC’s new global environmental sustainability targets are based on a 3-year program taking us to 2022, given the fast pace of change in our business. We maintain a commitment to absolute reduction targets, which aligns with the spirit of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Agreements. The plan uses FY 2019 as a baseline, with progress evaluated annually. GHG Emissions 20% absolute greenhouse gas emissions reduction (tCO2e) Covers the global office and data center portfolio and applies to scope 1 and 2 emissions and scope 3 travel emissions Energy Consumption 12% absolute energy reduction (MWh) Covers the global office and data center portfolio Renewable Energy Achieve 30% renewable electricity purchased or generated Covers the global office and data center portfolio Water 15% absolute reduction of mains water globally E-Waste Zero e-waste to landfill (%) through the promotion of re-use Waste 15% absolute reduction of waste generated globally (metric tonnes) o For more information, refer to our published Global Environmental Targets and Plan > LINK  Our environmental plan provides a committed platform for sustainable operations and delivery over 3 years and covers all DXC regions, facilities, and data centers owned or directly managed by DXC. We will build on this approach and, long term, we will strive to continually minimize our impact on the environment and improve resource efficiency in the areas of energy, data center management, natural resource protection, sustainable consumption, and travel and transportation.  We seek to occupy facilities that can demonstrate positive environmental impacts through ratings, such as BREEAM and LEED, which deliver not only improved environmental performance but also wellbeing benefits to our staff.  https://www.dxc.technology/cr/ds/102881/102889-energy_and_emissions_management CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 4 Q: Does your organisation have a process to identify the sustainability issues which will have a major impact on your operations? • DXC Technology follows the process of stakeholder engagement and materiality evaluation as detailed in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). We focus our CR activities on areas of greatest concern to DXC and our stakeholders. We evaluate these areas through a CR risk and opportunities matrix to assess the impact and likelihood of a risk or opportunity being realized. Our reporting prioritization is the result of a detailed stakeholder process, as well as previous engagement with stakeholders, including clients, analysts, employees, senior leadership team, suppliers, partners, community, investors/shareholders, government, and others. We prioritize these topics for reporting based on potential impact to our business and importance to our stakeholders. Through our customer and partner interviews, we have been assured by the fact that we correctly placed our significant aspects on our matrix. Refer to our latest CR Report – Materiality (page 15) for a published list of these issues. > LINK  Memberships and Awards Awards: o DXC is ranked in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) North America 2019.

WATER QUESTIONS Q: What is your public water reduction goal? For DXC Technology - 15% reduction in 3-years to FY2022.  Q: What activities do you do to reduce your Water footprint? Where the business has direct responsibility for site water management, records are kept of how much water is being used, noting annual consumption and cost, and are subject to the global reduction goal.  https://assets1.dxc.technology/investor_relations/downloads/DXC_Technology_Environment_Targets_-_technical_paper.pdf https://www.dxc.technology/cr/flxwd/145370-corporate_responsibility_and_sustainability_report CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 13 Examples of our water conservation improvements include • Improved building occupant awareness • Repairs to leaking taps or water systems • Installation of water efficient controls such as sensor taps, flow restrictors, dual flush toilets, and water efficient catering equipment • Improved water efficiency in landscaping activities • Rainwater harvesting – collection of rainwater in storage tanks from the roof area via the down pipes for irrigation, toilet flushing or potable water substitution if approved treatment installed onsite • Communication of water awareness to staff • Scheduling of repair works program to correct leaks identified during the water survey and other necessary infrastructure upgrades Q: What is your most recent yearly Water consumption for the Total Company (m3)? DXC’s Water portfolio since base year (FY17) and percentage difference: DXC Total FY17 FY19 % Difference Water (m3) 3,141,342 2,612,777 -17%  WASTE QUESTIONS Q: What is your public waste reduction goal? For DXC Technology – we have set a waste reduction goal of 15% to be achieved by FY2022. As a continuing programme during the FY19, DXC continued to achieve its zero e-waste to landfill target. Across the portfolio, 42% of electronic items otherwise going to waste, were resold. The remaining was further separated into valuable materials and fully recycled into other components. Q: What activities do you do to reduce your Waste to landfill? DXC electronic waste is mostly comprised of desktops, laptops, printers, monitors and servers. Because of our IT services activities, this type of waste is our main waste concern and we endeavor to be responsible when IT equipment nears the end of its functional life. DXC recognizes the potentially harmful environment and health effects of sending e-waste to landfill. We are committed to sending zero e-waste to landfill in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 of responsible consumption and production.  CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 14 We test used items to determine if they can be re-used, either within the company or by other organizations. We are ethically responsible for data security and ensure that no sensitive information is passed on when re-selling IT hardware that contains hard drives. This is to ensure DXC and its clients are protected from data breaches. All products we re-sell have their hard drives erased to government approved standards; any identification of the previous user is removed and the device is fully inspected and tested before re-sale. We recycle items that are functionally obsolete or beyond repair to extract resources such as rare earth metals by certified downstream contractors. Recycling of such materials for use in new items reduces the environmental impact of IT equipment manufacture. DXC employs three global contractors for e-waste management, facilitating company-wide reporting and monitoring against our “zero e-waste to landfill” target. For questions around hazardous waste, generally we do not receive, handle, store or issue hazardous materials as part of the scope of works for clients (given our role as IT service provider). However, our contractors may handle hazardous waste within our office and data centre facilities.

For more information, email CR@dxc.com • If talking about our products/services, we do not have environmental certifications for any of our offerings. However, manufacturers will often have certifications for their products (e.g., EPEAT) which we are able to use to assess the environmental impacts of the products within our offerings. For more information or a more tailored response to this area, email CR@dxc.com Choice of Green Buildings • The DXC HQ in Tysons, Virginia is designed to meet the requirements of the LEED Platinum certification. This is the latest in a series of DXC buildings that have excellent energy efficiency credentials, with natural lighting, insulation and an efficient layout providing a comfortable and energizing workplace for our employees. The move supports DXC’s approach to ensure occupied strategic offices meet the highest environmental credentials demonstrated through green certifications.  • Similarly, the DXC Paris office is designed to achieve high environmental quality against the French HQE certification and platinum in LEED.  • Our London Kings Cross office has a BREEAM Outstanding rating for its environmental features. The office gets its heating and hot water from energy-efficient local district heating network. Active chilled beams and opening windows allow both mechanical and natural ventilation.  Renewable Energy Contracts Increasing the amount of renewable energy in our portfolio is a key component of our strategy to minimize GHG emissions. We promote the generation of renewable and low-carbon energy onsite. Several facilities include solar photovoltaics and low-carbon heat provision, and this will be extended as viable sites are identified. A total of 680 megawatt hours was generated in FY 2019 — an increase of over 50% from FY 2018. DXC Technology has long-term contract to source renewable energy from a Texas wind farm where we offtake 78.4 MW. Its annual production of around 315 million kwh is enough to offset 100% of the power consumed in our five large Texas data centers and is expected to reduce our GHG emissions by more than 221,374 tons of CO2e (equal to 32,690 US homes’ electrical use for one year). Five DXC sites have solar installations, located in the United States, Mexico and India. Combined, they produce 4 million kWh of electricity, reducing our GHG emissions by 2,811 tons CO2e (equal to 415 US homes’ electrical use for one year). Additionally, a number of our DXC operations in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK source 100% of their electricity requirements from renewable resources.  Use of Solar Panels on DXC buildings DXC has developed an approach for renewable energy as part of the three-year targets with a focus upon energy efficiency first followed by purchasing renewable energy directly. The intention here is to avoid the use of electricity in the first place as a priority. Secondly, electricity that is consumed will increasingly be from a renewable resource where we can verify its source. mailto:psullivan5@dxc.com mailto:psullivan5@dxc.com CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 16 The addition of direct renewable technologies within buildings will also be reviewed in more detail, with costs reducing, this is becoming more favourable. DXC already has a number of facilities with solar PV panels on them generating electricity together with a wind farm which is majority owned. One of the biggest challenges faced is that DXC are tenants in many facilities and therefore does not have the ability to place solar panels on the facility. In addition, in some countries, such as India we must also consider the resilience of the electricity systems within buildings and the grid. Whilst the identification of suitable buildings is complex, DXC is committed to increasing the amount of renewable energy consumed as a proportion of the total electricity used. Environmental Compliance o Check latest via CR@dxc.com o Regions have different processes and procedures to ensure legal compliance.  Supporting our Client’s own environmental goals Q: If selected as a supplier, what would you propose XXX do to assist your company in reaching its environmental goals? DXC Technology’s Approach  DXC follows a strong set of environmental practices in the delivery of all our services. These include: A robust environmental management system DXC implements an environmental management system across its international operations, with formal ISO14001 accreditation held in key locations and is externally assessed by auditors LR.. This provides a co-ordinated structure that is understood by our teams helping to deliver good practice as part of our standard service. Ambitious carbon targets DXC globally has a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations by 20% against a FY19 baseline by FY2022. DXC also provides reporting through CDP Investors and CDP Supply Chain, the latter which looks to capture energy consumption for individual client organizations. We have the data and ability of capturing energy and GHG data at a server level. Carbon emissions arise in the supply of our services through a number of areas including the provision of the equipment, staff employed and their transport activities. Our approach incorporates factors including the use of virtualization, video-conferencing, centralization and infrastructure improvements, reducing travel and property-related emissions while improving productivity. Lifecycle costs and carbon impacts form part of the decision-making during the procurement of hardware and infrastructure equipment. This approach is aligned with the waste protocols where the refurbishment first approach will help to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the services provided. Secure and responsible electronic waste management DXC’s Environmental Plan includes a global target for zero electronic waste to landfill, with a focus on optimizing the waste hierarchy. Resources impacts arise from the procurement, delivery, use and disposal of hardware and infrastructure products procured and used. DXC has a duty of care to ensure the waste hierarchy is maintained. During procurement, DXC’s hardware and infrastructure providers promote the use of equipment that can be upgraded and utilize recycled content materials where feasible. When possible, we refurbish to mailto:CR@dxc.com CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 17 extend the lifespan of used equipment by as long as 3 years. After refurbishment, the products are reused either by repackaging and putting them into ‘customer owned’ stock for call off as required, selling them, or donating them to charity. Through this approach, we are ensuring IT equipment is re-used for a second life, providing innovative go-to-market solutions, to implement reverse supply chain and to ensure the secure and environmentally compliant disposition of DXC’s retired IT assets as well as the assets of DXC’s customers. A three stage process operates: 1. Promote refurbishment and redeployment of equipment where items meet the required specification, extending the life; 2. Where items are below the required specification, items will be sold on the market; 3. Only where the above options are not feasible, equipment is broken down and recycled.

See: LINK o At DXC, we seek to build and sustain supplier relationships and a global supply chain that reflect the core values of inclusion and diversity, human rights, health and safety, and environmental sustainability that are critical to us and to our clients and partners.  o Our forward-thinking approach to supply chain management helps ensure that our suppliers contribute to DXC’s responsible business practices in areas such as screening for abuses including slavery and the use of child labor; complying with environmental, health and safety regulations and industry best practices; and implementing rigorous programs to eliminate bribery and other illegal behavior. o DXC’s own Human Rights Statement was developed following the tenets of the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. DXC is a member of the UN Global Compact. o Underscoring these key commitments, our Responsible Supply Chain Principles establish a set of clear, detailed standards for doing business with DXC across five areas: 1. Human Rights 2. Labor 3. Bribery and Corruption 4. Environment 5. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion We expect our suppliers to create processes and programs that provide for alignment with our values. We consider adherence to our Responsible Supply Chain Principles when we select suppliers, and we reserve the right to monitor supplier processes and procedures against these principles as part of our ongoing Responsible Supply Chain Program.  Q. Does the company have processes to identify suppliers that are critical from the point of view of sustainability? As part of our supply chain screening.  Q. Does the company set targets for improvements in economic, social and environmental indicators with its critical suppliers. We do not set targets with our suppliers at this time.  Q. Describe how your organization will ensure that hardware products offered to [CLIENT] meet the highest of environmental standards. Where possible, DXC will provide guidance and advice to clients on the selection of equipment including hardware, servers and infrastructure. A list of approved equipment is in place, which includes energy efficiency criteria to ensure the selection process promotes good performance. We work closely with our partners to drive through improved environmental performance of these assets. For DXC this will be to promote the circular economy approach by supplying items that can be upgraded or easily dismantled. DXC applies this at the procurement stage where we require our hardware suppliers to deliver materials with reduced packaging, such as shrink-wrapped on pallets reducing the need for http://www.dxc.technology/cr/ds/82786-our_corporate_responsibility_policies_and_principles CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 19 individual packaging and cutting volumes significantly. During refresh programs, a separate waste skip will be provided, where space exists, to capture and dispose of materials on the day of delivery. Materials will be taken to an off-site facility for sorting with a view to re-using the items where possible. During procurement, our hardware and infrastructure providers promote the use of equipment that can be upgraded and utilize recycled content materials where feasible.  All hardware provided, including desktops, laptops, printers, monitors and servers will be EPEAT Bronze standard and above through the life of the contract, with a priority for Gold Standard. Given the changes in methodology and assessment used, EPEAT ratings of products may vary. Not all product types will have an EPEAT standard, and alternative standards will be used. After refurbishment, the products can be reused by repackaging and putting them into ‘customer owned’ stock for call off as required. Through this approach, we are ensuring IT equipment is re- used for a second life. Across our strategic data centers, ISO50001 has been implemented with a view to ensuring energy efficiency is a key factor in the provision of hardware, through reducing energy consumption, cooling demand and improved racking arrangements. Specification of energy efficient server equipment as a preference is recommended from the procurement list.

We expect our suppliers to make “good faith efforts” that will help us meet our Supplier Diversity goals and encourage all bidders to provide their most proactive, innovative diverse supplier solutions representing Best Practices on a national level, assuming the services will still be delivered in the most cost effective manner possible (i.e., added costs are unacceptable). Q. If awarded the business, and in light of our expressed expectations, what diverse spend target (as a percentage of our overall spend with your company) would you commit to in conjunction with extending the opportunity to diverse suppliers to work with your company? DXC Response: If there is an opportunity to subcontract, DXC Technology will work to include diverse suppliers. Additionally, DXC Technology can provide a quarterly indirect allocation of our diverse spend. DXC provides these types of quarterly reports to 30 current clients. Q. Explain how you plan to identify or reach out to diverse suppliers to satisfy your proposed spend target. DXC Response: It is the policy of DXC to affirmatively seek the participation of small business, small disadvantaged business and woman-owned small business concerns, as well as other similar groups in the performance of subcontracts and procurements. DXC expects its suppliers to be similarly aligned to these principles, including the selection of any indirect suppliers. Diverse supplier inclusion in the supply chain demonstrates DXC’s commitment to our corporate citizenship goals and customers’ successes through promoting business opportunities with suppliers that represent the communities in which we live and do business. DXC Technology engages small businesses, minority-, women-, and veteran-owned suppliers across a broad swath of procurement categories, including, but not limited to: • Contingent Labor • Professional Services • Marketing & Advertising • Business Services • Technology Services  These categories require a variety of skill sets with expertise in a wide range of industries, including Airlines, Banking/Finance, Health Care, Telecom and Technology.

Q: What activities do you do to reduce your Waste to landfill? DXC electronic waste is mostly comprised of desktops, laptops, printers, monitors and servers. Because of our IT services activities, this type of waste is our main waste concern and we endeavor to be responsible when IT equipment nears the end of its functional life. DXC recognizes the potentially harmful environment and health effects of sending e-waste to landfill. We are committed to sending zero e-waste to landfill in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 of responsible consumption and production.  CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 14 We test used items to determine if they can be re-used, either within the company or by other organizations. We are ethically responsible for data security and ensure that no sensitive information is passed on when re-selling IT hardware that contains hard drives. This is to ensure DXC and its clients are protected from data breaches. All products we re-sell have their hard drives erased to government approved standards; any identification of the previous user is removed and the device is fully inspected and tested before re-sale. We recycle items that are functionally obsolete or beyond repair to extract resources such as rare earth metals by certified downstream contractors. Recycling of such materials for use in new items reduces the environmental impact of IT equipment manufacture. DXC employs three global contractors for e-waste management, facilitating company-wide reporting and monitoring against our “zero e-waste to landfill” target. For questions around hazardous waste, generally we do not receive, handle, store or issue hazardous materials as part of the scope of works for clients (given our role as IT service provider). However, our contractors may handle hazardous waste within our office and data centre facilities.

For more information, email CR@dxc.com • If talking about our products/services, we do not have environmental certifications for any of our offerings. However, manufacturers will often have certifications for their products (e.g., EPEAT) which we are able to use to assess the environmental impacts of the products within our offerings. For more information or a more tailored response to this area, email CR@dxc.com Choice of Green Buildings • The DXC HQ in Tysons, Virginia is designed to meet the requirements of the LEED Platinum certification. This is the latest in a series of DXC buildings that have excellent energy efficiency credentials, with natural lighting, insulation and an efficient layout providing a comfortable and energizing workplace for our employees. The move supports DXC’s approach to ensure occupied strategic offices meet the highest environmental credentials demonstrated through green certifications.  • Similarly, the DXC Paris office is designed to achieve high environmental quality against the French HQE certification and platinum in LEED.  • Our London Kings Cross office has a BREEAM Outstanding rating for its environmental features. The office gets its heating and hot water from energy-efficient local district heating network. Active chilled beams and opening windows allow both mechanical and natural ventilation.  Renewable Energy Contracts Increasing the amount of renewable energy in our portfolio is a key component of our strategy to minimize GHG emissions. We promote the generation of renewable and low-carbon energy onsite. Several facilities include solar photovoltaics and low-carbon heat provision, and this will be extended as viable sites are identified. A total of 680 megawatt hours was generated in FY 2019 — an increase of over 50% from FY 2018. DXC Technology has long-term contract to source renewable energy from a Texas wind farm where we offtake 78.4 MW. Its annual production of around 315 million kwh is enough to offset 100% of the power consumed in our five large Texas data centers and is expected to reduce our GHG emissions by more than 221,374 tons of CO2e (equal to 32,690 US homes’ electrical use for one year). Five DXC sites have solar installations, located in the United States, Mexico and India. Combined, they produce 4 million kWh of electricity, reducing our GHG emissions by 2,811 tons CO2e (equal to 415 US homes’ electrical use for one year). Additionally, a number of our DXC operations in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK source 100% of their electricity requirements from renewable resources.  Use of Solar Panels on DXC buildings DXC has developed an approach for renewable energy as part of the three-year targets with a focus upon energy efficiency first followed by purchasing renewable energy directly. The intention here is to avoid the use of electricity in the first place as a priority. Secondly, electricity that is consumed will increasingly be from a renewable resource where we can verify its source. mailto:psullivan5@dxc.com mailto:psullivan5@dxc.com CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 16 The addition of direct renewable technologies within buildings will also be reviewed in more detail, with costs reducing, this is becoming more favourable. DXC already has a number of facilities with solar PV panels on them generating electricity together with a wind farm which is majority owned. One of the biggest challenges faced is that DXC are tenants in many facilities and therefore does not have the ability to place solar panels on the facility. In addition, in some countries, such as India we must also consider the resilience of the electricity systems within buildings and the grid. Whilst the identification of suitable buildings is complex, DXC is committed to increasing the amount of renewable energy consumed as a proportion of the total electricity used. Environmental Compliance o Check latest via CR@dxc.com o Regions have different processes and procedures to ensure legal compliance.  Supporting our Client’s own environmental goals Q: If selected as a supplier, what would you propose XXX do to assist your company in reaching its environmental goals? DXC Technology’s Approach  DXC follows a strong set of environmental practices in the delivery of all our services. These include: A robust environmental management system DXC implements an environmental management system across its international operations, with formal ISO14001 accreditation held in key locations and is externally assessed by auditors LR.. This provides a co-ordinated structure that is understood by our teams helping to deliver good practice as part of our standard service. Ambitious carbon targets DXC globally has a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations by 20% against a FY19 baseline by FY2022. DXC also provides reporting through CDP Investors and CDP Supply Chain, the latter which looks to capture energy consumption for individual client organizations. We have the data and ability of capturing energy and GHG data at a server level. Carbon emissions arise in the supply of our services through a number of areas including the provision of the equipment, staff employed and their transport activities. Our approach incorporates factors including the use of virtualization, video-conferencing, centralization and infrastructure improvements, reducing travel and property-related emissions while improving productivity. Lifecycle costs and carbon impacts form part of the decision-making during the procurement of hardware and infrastructure equipment. This approach is aligned with the waste protocols where the refurbishment first approach will help to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the services provided. Secure and responsible electronic waste management DXC’s Environmental Plan includes a global target for zero electronic waste to landfill, with a focus on optimizing the waste hierarchy. Resources impacts arise from the procurement, delivery, use and disposal of hardware and infrastructure products procured and used. DXC has a duty of care to ensure the waste hierarchy is maintained. During procurement, DXC’s hardware and infrastructure providers promote the use of equipment that can be upgraded and utilize recycled content materials where feasible. When possible, we refurbish to mailto:CR@dxc.com CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 17 extend the lifespan of used equipment by as long as 3 years. After refurbishment, the products are reused either by repackaging and putting them into ‘customer owned’ stock for call off as required, selling them, or donating them to charity. Through this approach, we are ensuring IT equipment is re-used for a second life, providing innovative go-to-market solutions, to implement reverse supply chain and to ensure the secure and environmentally compliant disposition of DXC’s retired IT assets as well as the assets of DXC’s customers. A three stage process operates: 1. Promote refurbishment and redeployment of equipment where items meet the required specification, extending the life; 2. Where items are below the required specification, items will be sold on the market; 3. Only where the above options are not feasible, equipment is broken down and recycled.  GOVERNANCE • Ethics, Anti Bribery and Corruption o DXC has a robust ethics, anti-bribery and anti-corruption program, including a chief ethics and compliance officer Chris DePippo who reports directly to the Board > LINK o DXC’s Code of Business Conduct spells out our expectations for the commitments we make to each other and our company, to our clients and shareholders and to the communities in which we live and work.

See: LINK o At DXC, we seek to build and sustain supplier relationships and a global supply chain that reflect the core values of inclusion and diversity, human rights, health and safety, and environmental sustainability that are critical to us and to our clients and partners.  o Our forward-thinking approach to supply chain management helps ensure that our suppliers contribute to DXC’s responsible business practices in areas such as screening for abuses including slavery and the use of child labor; complying with environmental, health and safety regulations and industry best practices; and implementing rigorous programs to eliminate bribery and other illegal behavior. o DXC’s own Human Rights Statement was developed following the tenets of the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. DXC is a member of the UN Global Compact. o Underscoring these key commitments, our Responsible Supply Chain Principles establish a set of clear, detailed standards for doing business with DXC across five areas: 1. Human Rights 2. Labor 3. Bribery and Corruption 4. Environment 5. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion We expect our suppliers to create processes and programs that provide for alignment with our values. We consider adherence to our Responsible Supply Chain Principles when we select suppliers, and we reserve the right to monitor supplier processes and procedures against these principles as part of our ongoing Responsible Supply Chain Program.  Q. Does the company have processes to identify suppliers that are critical from the point of view of sustainability? As part of our supply chain screening.  Q. Does the company set targets for improvements in economic, social and environmental indicators with its critical suppliers. We do not set targets with our suppliers at this time.  Q. Describe how your organization will ensure that hardware products offered to [CLIENT] meet the highest of environmental standards. Where possible, DXC will provide guidance and advice to clients on the selection of equipment including hardware, servers and infrastructure. A list of approved equipment is in place, which includes energy efficiency criteria to ensure the selection process promotes good performance. We work closely with our partners to drive through improved environmental performance of these assets. For DXC this will be to promote the circular economy approach by supplying items that can be upgraded or easily dismantled. DXC applies this at the procurement stage where we require our hardware suppliers to deliver materials with reduced packaging, such as shrink-wrapped on pallets reducing the need for http://www.dxc.technology/cr/ds/82786-our_corporate_responsibility_policies_and_principles CR Inquiry FAQ’s – Page 19 individual packaging and cutting volumes significantly. During refresh programs, a separate waste skip will be provided, where space exists, to capture and dispose of materials on the day of delivery. Materials will be taken to an off-site facility for sorting with a view to re-using the items where possible. During procurement, our hardware and infrastructure providers promote the use of equipment that can be upgraded and utilize recycled content materials where feasible.  All hardware provided, including desktops, laptops, printers, monitors and servers will be EPEAT Bronze standard and above through the life of the contract, with a priority for Gold Standard. Given the changes in methodology and assessment used, EPEAT ratings of products may vary. Not all product types will have an EPEAT standard, and alternative standards will be used. After refurbishment, the products can be reused by repackaging and putting them into ‘customer owned’ stock for call off as required. Through this approach, we are ensuring IT equipment is re- used for a second life. Across our strategic data centers, ISO50001 has been implemented with a view to ensuring energy efficiency is a key factor in the provision of hardware, through reducing energy consumption, cooling demand and improved racking arrangements. Specification of energy efficient server equipment as a preference is recommended from the procurement list.

DXC Bionix™ is our digital-generation services delivery model that provides intelligent automation at scale. With DXC Bionix-enabled solutions, clients can maximize performance and value of their existing investments — to help accelerate their digital transformations. The Bionix approach combines Analytics & Artificial Intelligence, Lean and Automation. So what DXC Bionix gives us is an intelligent integrated environment that enables greater insight, speed and efficiency for IT operations. Let me share an example of how it works. The Bionix approach starts with data. We apply data mining, machine learning and predictive intelligence to gain real-time insights into the business and its operations. The insights generated through data science methods tell us where to take action. The data tells us where we need to apply lean techniques to optimize processes and improve team performance for increased quality, consistency and outcomes. Data also tells us where we should apply tools and automate work. There is no value in automating a broken process or one that is not adding value and could be eliminated. For each business scenario, we review our toolkit to identify the most appropriate tool or technology to apply. This includes leveraging IP and tools from our vast partner network. Deploying automation solutions makes our work easier and faster, increasing the overall speed and quality of our service delivery to clients. And for our own organization -- we've been doing this since the launch of DXC – across our delivery centers for our more than 6000 managed service clients. From a pure efficiency perspective, we've seen hundreds of millions of dollars bottom line improvement. Let’s talk further about the end-to-end Bionix approach and how this holistic approach can simplify and lower the cost of an organization’s existing IT operations, freeing up funding that can be invested in digital transformation. 19 Why DXC is the Answer:       October 15, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Launched mainframe outsourcing business in 1962 and now manage 30% of world MIPS We combine deep infrastructure and application expertise, with end to end automation and integrated modern dev ops Extensive insurance software portfolio DXC Technology has an extensive portfolio of complementary offerings for the claim and risk management industry.

Service Enable Focus on Technology Change Focus on Functional Change Key Drivers for Change Take no transformation action Remove from the landscape. (This would need data archiving, data access mechanisms as well as handling impact on interfacing applications) Change infrastructure environment without functional change (e.g. lift and shift) Change the technology platform without functional change (e.g. change language, O/S, DB) Alter the application design while retaining functional equivalency. A type of refactor where the altered design is based on a service oriented architecture. Merge multiple applications with similar functionality into fewer applications. Refactor the application and deliver new functionality. Move the application to a later release taking advantage of new functional and technical capabilities. Re-discover the business requirements and re-build the application from the “ground up”. Remove the application from the landscape, replacing it with a new package based application (e.g. COTS).

DXC Bionix™ is our digital-generation services delivery model that provides intelligent automation at scale. With DXC Bionix-enabled solutions, clients can maximize performance and value of their existing investments — to help accelerate their digital transformations. The Bionix approach combines Analytics & Artificial Intelligence, Lean and Automation. So what DXC Bionix gives us is an intelligent integrated environment that enables greater insight, speed and efficiency for IT operations. Let me share an example of how it works. The Bionix approach starts with data. We apply data mining, machine learning and predictive intelligence to gain real-time insights into the business and its operations. The insights generated through data science methods tell us where to take action. The data tells us where we need to apply lean techniques to optimize processes and improve team performance for increased quality, consistency and outcomes. Data also tells us where we should apply tools and automate work. There is no value in automating a broken process or one that is not adding value and could be eliminated. For each business scenario, we review our toolkit to identify the most appropriate tool or technology to apply. This includes leveraging IP and tools from our vast partner network. Deploying automation solutions makes our work easier and faster, increasing the overall speed and quality of our service delivery to clients. And for our own organization -- we've been doing this since the launch of DXC – across our delivery centers for our more than 6000 managed service clients. From a pure efficiency perspective, we've seen hundreds of millions of dollars bottom line improvement. Let’s talk further about the end-to-end Bionix approach and how this holistic approach can simplify and lower the cost of an organization’s existing IT operations, freeing up funding that can be invested in digital transformation. 19 Why DXC is the Answer:       October 15, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential Launched mainframe outsourcing business in 1962 and now manage 30% of world MIPS We combine deep infrastructure and application expertise, with end to end automation and integrated modern dev ops Extensive insurance software portfolio DXC Technology has an extensive portfolio of complementary offerings for the claim and risk management industry.

Its 13 pharmacists and five pharmacy technicians must keep accurate inventory records of all medicines in stock, dispense medicines in the correct dosages and to the right wards and patients, and complete all associated billing and financial accounting in a timely way. But unlike many healthcare providers, MidCentral DHB — which provides public health services for a region of New Zealand that’s home to nearly 179,000 people — was trying to do all this with a collection of five software solutions, each from a different vendor and each unable to share data with the others. Some of these systems still ran on the 1980s-era DOS (disk operating system), received new data via a command line and could not accommodate a mouse. “It was an absolute nightmare,” says Lorraine Welman, chief pharmacist at MidCentral District Health Board. Because the legacy systems could not share data, achieving a transparent view of pharmacy stock movements was impossible. This meant medicines were often overstocked, which, in turn, led to expired — and therefore wasted — medicines. In addition, dispensing medicines involved a labor-intensive process, one that took ward nurses from time with patients to sign off on every incoming package. Errors were not uncommon; labels were misprinted and medicines were dispensed in the wrong quantities. As a result, some processes had to be repeated as many as three times before being completed correctly. “It was essentially a guessing game,” Welman says. “Everything was a workaround.” Streamlining to a modern system For help moving MidCentral DHB’s hospital from the siloed legacy systems to what Welman refers to as “the modern times,” the region’s shared IT-services agency engaged DXC Technology in early 2013. The work began with an implementation study and a series of planning workshops, which resulted in a project roadmap, method and scope. “We recommended streamlining by consolidating all of the systems onto one modern system,” says DXC project director Simon Green. The big question was how, and by whom, this regional system would be funded. Following extensive consultation in 2015 across MidCentral DHB, it was decided that the pharmacy-management system would be adopted by another two of the Central Region’s six district health boards, and that MidCentral DHB would work directly with DXC. Work progressed in mid-2016, and the system launched in early 2017. “It was a smooth and successful go-live,” DXC’s Green says. MidCentral DHB’s new unified pharmacy-management system is powered by DXC Pharmacy Management, a scalable software solution designed to accurately maintain inventory movements in a multi-organizational, multi-site, multi-store environment. The solution’s modules cover multiple pharmacy processes, including patient dispensing, extemporaneous dispensing and compounding (enabling a pharmacy to custom-manufacture medicine for a single patient), repackaging, supply chain, stock control, ward stock, drug files, labeling, reporting and security. Challenge: • A complicated mix of five mutually incompatible legacy pharmacy- management systems • Incompatibility that led to errors, wasted medicine, time-consuming manual processes and high costs • Systems difficult to use, resulting in low employee engagement Solution: • Replace multiple legacy pharmacy-management systems with a single unified system • Implement DXC Pharmacy Management (ePharmacy in New Zealand) in-hospital dispensing system Results: • Stock wastage reduced, resulting in cost savings of NZ$182,000 in first year, three times the expected return • Number of prescriptions dispensed increased by 45 percent per day • Greater visibility into stock on hand in both pharmacy and wards, lowering inventory and reducing expired and wasted medicines • Elimination of many manual processes; improved staff engagement and clinical decision support • Enhanced patient safety Case Study: MidCentral District Health Board 2 Immediate benefits Among the many benefits have been major gains from the stock-management module. The new system enables the delivery of medicine in smaller quantities; this reduces the quantities of medicines stored in the hospital wards, lowering both costs and the risk of medicines passing their expiration date. “We can now manage all the way down to the last tablet,” says DXC’s Green. Also, the hospital’s wards have been equipped with three wireless scanners to check in commonly used medicines. Later, when those drugs are dispensed to patients, information is wirelessly transmitted to the pharmacy, saving time, increasing the reliability of records and reducing dispensing errors. Costs have been reduced, too. Welman credits the new pharmacy management solution with first-year savings of NZ$182,000, or more than 1 percent of the hospital’s total spending on medicines. Not incidentally, that’s three times the savings originally expected. Another benefit has been a dramatic increase in the number of prescriptions the hospital’s pharmacy can dispense. With the older legacy systems, errors often plagued prescription-related activities, requiring them to be repeated — sometimes up to three times — until they were correct. Because the new system eliminates these errors, each prescription can be dispensed accurately and in less time, streamlining outpatient services, where most bottlenecks occur. It also means that nearly 45 percent more prescriptions can be dispensed every day — more than twice what had been expected. “That,” Welman says, “has been massive.” Looking ahead, Welman and her team hope to continue working with DXC to achieve a closed-loop, end-to-end medication management system. The next steps involve integrating DXC’s solution with a paperless system for medication orders and rolling out an automated dispensing system across the hospital. “Everything we’ve done so far has been met with absolute relief from the staff,” Welman says. “Engaging with our customers — patients, nurses, doctors and others — is now a pleasure. And engaging with DXC has given us a lot of faith in the company and what it can deliver.” About DXC Technology DXC Technology, the world’s leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, manages and modernizes mission-critical systems, integrating them with new digital solutions to produce better business outcomes.

Case Study: MidCentral District Health Board http://www.dxc.technology http://www.dxc.technology/optin http://www.dxc.technology/healthcare http://www.dxc.technology/healthcare ",0,MidCentral DHB streamlines pharmacy management with digital solution: Client Case Study,0,"ePharmacy, New Zealand, Pharmacy Management, Healthcare, Outpatient Services DXC helped bring MidCentral DHB's pharmacy management into the modern era with a unified digital solution  MidCentral District Health Board streamlines pharmacy management with digital solution Client name: MidCentral District Health Board Location: New Zealand Industry: Healthcare Case Study: MidCentral District Health Board  Like hospitals everywhere, MidCentral District Health Board’s (DHB) Palmerston North Hospital must carefully manage its pharmacy. Its 13 pharmacists and five pharmacy technicians must keep accurate inventory records of all medicines in stock, dispense medicines in the correct dosages and to the right wards and patients, and complete all associated billing and financial accounting in a timely way. But unlike many healthcare providers, MidCentral DHB — which provides public health services for a region of New Zealand that’s home to nearly 179,000 people — was trying to do all this with a collection of five software solutions, each from a different vendor and each unable to share data with the others. Some of these systems still ran on the 1980s-era DOS (disk operating system), received new data via a command line and could not accommodate a mouse. “It was an absolute nightmare,” says Lorraine Welman, chief pharmacist at MidCentral District Health Board. Because the legacy systems could not share data, achieving a transparent view of pharmacy stock movements was impossible. This meant medicines were often overstocked, which, in turn, led to expired — and therefore wasted — medicines. In addition, dispensing medicines involved a labor-intensive process, one that took ward nurses from time with patients to sign off on every incoming package. Errors were not uncommon; labels were misprinted and medicines were dispensed in the wrong quantities. As a result, some processes had to be repeated as many as three times before being completed correctly. “It was essentially a guessing game,” Welman says. “Everything was a workaround.” Streamlining to a modern system For help moving MidCentral DHB’s hospital from the siloed legacy systems to what Welman refers to as “the modern times,” the region’s shared IT-services agency engaged DXC Technology in early 2013. The work began with an implementation study and a series of planning workshops, which resulted in a project roadmap, method and scope. “We recommended streamlining by consolidating all of the systems onto one modern system,” says DXC project director Simon Green. The big question was how, and by whom, this regional system would be funded. Following extensive consultation in 2015 across MidCentral DHB, it was decided that the pharmacy-management system would be adopted by another two of the Central Region’s six district health boards, and that MidCentral DHB would work directly with DXC. Work progressed in mid-2016, and the system launched in early 2017. “It was a smooth and successful go-live,” DXC’s Green says. MidCentral DHB’s new unified pharmacy-management system is powered by DXC Pharmacy Management, a scalable software solution designed to accurately maintain inventory movements in a multi-organizational, multi-site, multi-store environment. The solution’s modules cover multiple pharmacy processes, including patient dispensing, extemporaneous dispensing and compounding (enabling a pharmacy to custom-manufacture medicine for a single patient), repackaging, supply chain, stock control, ward stock, drug files, labeling, reporting and security.

It is ranked as number 30 in the Global Forbes list. Santander counts 200,000 employees and earned an attributable profit of €7,8 billion in 2018. Client Business Problem Solved Santander was experiencing a lot of challenges related to IT compliance and security stress due to the complexity to maintain and keep up to date its IT platform. The client published an RFP and gave DXC just a week to demonstrate its capabilities in the relevant domains. Expected Client Outcome or Metric DXC is responsible for managing Santander’s internal IT compliance on their current IT platform (12,000 servers and 6,000 desktop), by keeping it updated (latest software versions), avoiding security and obsolescence issues. We will also create compliance dashboards for their CIO and CISO. We will also automatize part of the deployment process, bringing new capabilities to Santander IT. With this service, Santander aims to have a dashboard to control their current IT platform software compliance, and to assure visibility of IT obsolescence. Securing the Win We won, against Everis, Accenture and IBM, because our approach aligned with Santander’s needs. We invited them to our DXC Delivery Center in the North of Spain, where they met our operations team and evaluated what we are already delivering to other customers, such as Zurich or Caixabank. Finally, our value proposition relies on our capability to offer a balanced onsite-near shoring service from Spain, with a strong skilled IT team and at a competitive price, which strongly appeared to the customer. Strategic Importance This service is key for us as it will show how DXC can run part or their IT critical mission in an onsite-nearshore model and will allow DXC to grow its footprint inside this customer.

What We Sell pages undergo a general review during edits and page additions, to ensure they comply with these  standards: Is the content understandable and easy to read? Is grammar/spelling correct?  Are acronyms defined?  Is it factual and free of jargon/informal speech? Asset Properties (Metatag) Standards Use the following guidelines to apply properties (metatags) to assets featured on What We Sell. The asset metadata determines how the asset is displayed and how it is indexed by search. Content owners are accountable and responsible for the quality of the content within each of their documents. The What We Sell team ensures the metatag standards are appropriately applied and that each downloadable aligns to the metatags. If your document does not conform to these quality standards, your document will be proactively updated by the What We Sell team without notice.   Asset Title    Do not use undefined acronyms   Should be Title Case   Remove ""DXC"" from the offering name unless the offering name features a partner   Follow this format: [Offering] or [Title/Topic]: [Asset Type]       Ex: Storage as a Service: Client Presentation        Updated Date    Set the Updated Date to match the last meaningful update of the asset   Keywords    Use keywords that are directly relevant to the content, words that users may use to search for the content   Abstract    Do not use undefined acronyms   Should explain what's inside the document, intended audience, and how to use it Keep to 2-3 short sentences in length  Audience    Select only the audience(s) to which the asset is exclusively relevant - sales, solutioning, or both   Restriction Classification    Set the restriction level appropriate to the content   Match the What We Sell level to the level set within the asset (especially for Internal Use Only!)     Sales Stage    Select only the applicable sales stage(s) when this asset would most likely be used Reference Asset Mapping Guidelines for Audience and Sales Stage: Instructions for suggested alignment for common asset types  Region    Select a specific region only if the content is customized for that region   Industry    Select an industry vertical only if the content is customized for an industry  Asset Brand    The asset brand should correspond to the company brand design/colors used to create the asset   Associated Offerings    Once the asset is loaded, associate to relevant offerings through the “Associate My Asset to a Page” function:       Do not associate assets to “related” offerings    Associated offerings must be mentioned in the document and the mention must be substantive    Do not associate Certified assets to non-certified offerings        Each Attachment    Attachment Title   Provide a title which that display when there are multiple versions (translations, video + transcript, etc.)   Language   Indicate the document's language   Page Format   Indicate the document's page format (US Letter, A4, etc.)   Usage and Relevance Standards If your document has not received any downloads on What We Sell in the last 12 months (excluding yourself), your document may be removed from What We Sell. Ratings and Reviews Policies  WWS content owners are not allowed to influence reviewers to change their reviews unless the content owner has addressed the specific review comments in a content update. Reset Your Rating Ratings and reviews can be reset after significant content changes or improvements. Improve Your Rating Use concrete and quantitative data points such as ""15 cloud-enabled data centers.""  Review asset to ensure documents are fresh, relevant, and clear.  Write for flow and clarity using short, clear, and complete sentences.  Avoid marketing “fluff” that otherwise obfuscates and obscures meaning. For example, avoid phrases such as, “A holistic solution to improve processes.”  Avoid content that is too generic or high-level. For example, avoid phrases such as, “DXC is always the best.”  Use search-engine friendly (keyword-dense) copy within your web page, your asset , and the keyword field of Manage My Asset.  Spell out the first instance of an abbreviation such as, ""Interactive Media Command Center (IMCC) Solution."" Spelling out the first instance of an abbreviation makes content more user and search engine friendly. Tips for Document Owners Search Indexing for Documents Timing The amount of time it takes for a document to show up in WWS search results depends on the number of documents in the queue to be indexed. It typically takes 10 minutes for a new or updated document to show up in search results. When you add or update  a document, it will be added to the search queue to be indexed. If it's been more than 24 hours since a document was set as active and it's still not showing up in search, please contact WWS Support Desk. Documents with multiple attachments If you have multiple attachments for your document, only the first one will be indexed by the search engine. It will be marked with an indexed icon  . This means that the search engine will read through the document's verbiage and use it to determine whether or not it matches the keywords that someone is searching by. Example: Let's say you have an English document that has also been translated into German and Spanish. You attach all three of the versions to your document and make the English version first in the list. The search engine will only look through the English  version (not the Spanish or German versions), so only English keywords will trigger the document to show up in search results. E.g. The document would show up in the search results if you searched using the English keyword ""technology,"" but not if  you used ""technologie"" (German) or ""tecnología"" (Spanish). Document Dates  Document dates are managed via the Update Properties page for that particular document. To access the metadata, click the button on the Manage My Asset page. There are 3 date fields on the Update MetaData page: updated date, go live date, expiration date.   Updated date  This is the date that is displayed in search results and on web pages.  The updated date field is auto-populated when the document is initially added to What We Sell.  If you update the document's attachment, you must manually update this date to update the document date that's shown to users.  Go live date  The go-live date field is auto-populated when a document is initially added to What We Sell.  If you are loading documents into WWS ahead of a launch and don't want them to show up in search, change this field to be the date on which you want the documents to go live. Until then, the search engine will not index them or display them in results.  Expiration date  The expiration date field is auto-populated when a document is initially added to What We Sell. The date will be one year in the future. This is the date that the document will be expired and removed from What We Sell.  When you make significant changes to a document, manually update this field to extend the expiration date. Inactive documents If you delete all the attachments from your document, the document will be marked as ""inactive"" in WWS. This means that it will not appear on any webpages or show up in search results. However, it will remain in the system as an empty shell (with its  metadata intact), so that you can reactivate it at a later time. It typically takes 2 hours for inactive documents to be hidden from search results and webpages on What We Sell. On rare occasions, it will take longer. If it's been more than 24 hours since a document was set as inactive and it's still showing up (on  pages other than your user profile), please contact WWS Support Desk. If you no longer need a document, please delete it instead of inactivating it. Client Logos External client logo usage Requires permission from client. Internal client logo usage Requires permission from AGM/Account Team. Client logos have special requirements and, in most cases, should not be included in your assets due to the risk they pose to DXC if used incorrectly. Presume that every asset you post has a high likelihood of being used externally, even if marked Internal Use Only. Consider writing a use case instead of using a client logo.

A software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution was developed to provide a local and national view, with a provision for supporting and training resources for more than 700 users.","  Information Hub provides data-driven insights for Scottish Government Client name: Scottish Government Location: Edinburgh, United Kingdom Industry: Global Public Sector Success Story: Scottish Government 2 Challenges • Provide clarity and visibility into spending • Implement consistency and best practices • Establish standards for procurement of goods and services Solution • Management information to execute the Public Procurement Reform Program • Data classification and enhancement through a bespoke data processing system • Data visualisation through a software-as-a-service solution with a holistic view Results • Provided data collection services for 106 public sector organisations • Developed electronic procurement tools to promote excellence • Provided support and training for more than 700 users The Scottish Government wanted to create an information centre to reliably manage its procurements. It saw procurement as a key partner and enabler in delivering its economic strategy. Procurement is central to maximising the contribution and impact on sustainable economic growth and delivering better outcomes for Scotland’s businesses. The government has a range of responsibilities that include the economy, education, health, justice, rural affairs, housing, environment, equal opportunities, consumer advocacy and advice, transportation and taxation. The government spends over £11 billion ($14.5 billion) per year on goods and services across the public sector. Its aim is to work with the public, private and third sectors to deliver maximum value through public procurement activity. Scottish Procurement Information Hub (the Hub) The government performed an official review of public procurement in Scotland in 2006. Based on the report’s recommendations, the Scottish Procurement Directorate, a part of the Scottish Government, set up a Public Procurement Reform Program that aimed to drive standards for procurement of public sector goods, works and services. The reform activity included introducing a comprehensive, linked suite of electronic procurement tools to promote excellence, consistency and best practices in public procurement. Since the review indicated there was a lack of clarity and visibility about public sector spending, the Scottish Procurement Information Hub (the Hub) was established as part of the suite of electronic tools. DXC Technology developed a process to collect, standardise and transform accounts payable, credit card and contracts data from multiple entities, systems and sources. Stakeholders were engaged at the local level to ensure their participation in a centrally funded project. DXC created a managed service for the collection, checking and correction of all data files and established an automated data-enhancement process, supported by manual validation of results. The data was augmented with information from external data sources, while DXC performed the data-checking and cleansing services. A software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution was developed to provide a local and national view, with a provision for supporting and training resources for more than 700 users. The Hub, also referred to as the “Observatory,” allows more than 100 Scottish public sector bodies to examine procurement spending by analysing accounts payable data. This service has been provided by Spikes Cavell Analytic Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of DXC Technology) for over 10 years and is fully funded by the Scottish Government. The Hub helps procurement professionals analyse the expenditures on external goods and services from third-party suppliers. Additionally, it can be used to identify potential collaborative opportunities that could deliver significant savings for the public sector in Scotland.  Success Story: Scottish Government Local companies gain The management information comes from the Hub, which is the front end of a SQL database that DXC hosts and maintains for the Scottish Government. The database contains approximately £130 billion ($170 billion) of spending data collected over the period of the contract to date. Designed by Spikes Cavell to meet the customer’s requirements, the Hub is a simple system to use, allowing business users to extract information that informs their procurement strategies and actions. Over the term of the contract, the Hub has been developed and enhanced to meet the changing needs of the Scottish public sector for procurement management information, and DXC has delivered these services to the Scottish Government since 2006. The management information system has helped public sector organisations assess the potential for increasing economic activity in a local area or region. It has also helped identify potential local suppliers and areas that could benefit from the economic support. In addition, it helped these organisations make informed decisions on developing supply chain activity. The information provides guidance to local companies on how they can best bid for an increased share of public sector spending on goods and services. Also, with the aid of the information from the Hub, Scottish Procurement has developed various statistical reports that are used to answer official requests for information relating to Scottish Government and Scottish public sector spending. Information from the Hub has helped the Scottish Government track and analyse spending activity for small to medium-sized enterprises — which are critical to the economic health of the country — allowing the government to target support to such firms. www.dxc.technology About DXC Technology DXC Technology (NYSE: DXC) is the world’s leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, helping clients harness the power of innovation to thrive on change.

It saw procurement as a key partner and enabler in delivering its economic strategy. Procurement is central to maximising the contribution and impact on sustainable economic growth and delivering better outcomes for Scotland’s businesses. The government has a range of responsibilities that include the economy, education, health, justice, rural affairs, housing, environment, equal opportunities, consumer advocacy and advice, transportation and taxation. The government spends over £11 billion ($14.5 billion) per year on goods and services across the public sector. Its aim is to work with the public, private and third sectors to deliver maximum value through public procurement activity. Scottish Procurement Information Hub (the Hub) The government performed an official review of public procurement in Scotland in 2006. Based on the report’s recommendations, the Scottish Procurement Directorate, a part of the Scottish Government, set up a Public Procurement Reform Program that aimed to drive standards for procurement of public sector goods, works and services. The reform activity included introducing a comprehensive, linked suite of electronic procurement tools to promote excellence, consistency and best practices in public procurement. Since the review indicated there was a lack of clarity and visibility about public sector spending, the Scottish Procurement Information Hub (the Hub) was established as part of the suite of electronic tools. DXC Technology developed a process to collect, standardise and transform accounts payable, credit card and contracts data from multiple entities, systems and sources. Stakeholders were engaged at the local level to ensure their participation in a centrally funded project. DXC created a managed service for the collection, checking and correction of all data files and established an automated data-enhancement process, supported by manual validation of results. The data was augmented with information from external data sources, while DXC performed the data-checking and cleansing services. A software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution was developed to provide a local and national view, with a provision for supporting and training resources for more than 700 users. The Hub, also referred to as the “Observatory,” allows more than 100 Scottish public sector bodies to examine procurement spending by analysing accounts payable data. This service has been provided by Spikes Cavell Analytic Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of DXC Technology) for over 10 years and is fully funded by the Scottish Government. The Hub helps procurement professionals analyse the expenditures on external goods and services from third-party suppliers. Additionally, it can be used to identify potential collaborative opportunities that could deliver significant savings for the public sector in Scotland.  Success Story: Scottish Government Local companies gain The management information comes from the Hub, which is the front end of a SQL database that DXC hosts and maintains for the Scottish Government. The database contains approximately £130 billion ($170 billion) of spending data collected over the period of the contract to date. Designed by Spikes Cavell to meet the customer’s requirements, the Hub is a simple system to use, allowing business users to extract information that informs their procurement strategies and actions. Over the term of the contract, the Hub has been developed and enhanced to meet the changing needs of the Scottish public sector for procurement management information, and DXC has delivered these services to the Scottish Government since 2006. The management information system has helped public sector organisations assess the potential for increasing economic activity in a local area or region. It has also helped identify potential local suppliers and areas that could benefit from the economic support. In addition, it helped these organisations make informed decisions on developing supply chain activity. The information provides guidance to local companies on how they can best bid for an increased share of public sector spending on goods and services.

All rights reserved. DXC Technology’s CLEAR Values are an important competitive differentiator and intangible driver of our company’s success. They define all we do and who we are; our CLEAR Values are the distinguishing hallmarks of DXC performance and reputation. DXC clients and business partners the world over know that our leaders have long committed to a strong culture of ethics and performance with integrity — a culture in which the way we achieve our objectives and conduct ourselves matters as much as, if not more than, the results. Consequently, ours is a proud heritage marked by the experience of clients and partners who, over many years and through thick and thin, can point to circumstances in which the commitment of our teams to integrity and values was a reassuring difference-maker that deepened trust and, occasionally, restored confidence. So, we know from real experience that values-driven performance with integrity defines our today and secures our tomorrow. In many ways, the CLEAR Values are the “special sauce” of DXC. We depend on our values to harmonize interactions with each other and among our clients, business partners, and competitors. The CLEAR Values unify us in all organizations and worksites, and link us as one, whether we’re physically co-located or members of virtual teams. As well, our CLEAR Values align us to objectives as effective teammates without regard for titles or differences in workplace responsibility. Also important is the effect our values have on decision-making and personal responsibility. We trust our CLEAR Values to inform employee instincts in fast-moving circumstances when there’s little time to “get it right.” Likewise, they ground our actions in responsibility and integrity when risk taking and innovation are required. Indeed, we believe decisions and actions taken consistent with our CLEAR Values are time and again the right decisions, and always good business. At DXC, integrity, culture, and these CLEAR Values will remain vitally important to us. Our people know there are not any circumstances in which it is appropriate to abandon these ideals. We believe they drive an enduring confidence and trust that secures our industry leadership. So, we embrace a culture of integrity and these CLEAR Values with a mind to far exceed minimal compliance standards, always and everywhere. At DXC Technology, we expect and accept nothing less. 15 About DXC Technology DXC Technology, the world’s leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, manages and modernizes mission-critical systems, integrating them with new digital solutions to produce better business outcomes.

On an exception case a customer service user with limited access rights can be created to support special requirements like access file-share interface hosted in P4S by customer. The P4S Windows IAM (Identity Access Management) aims to provide centralized, unified, secure and scalable user access management for DXC support people from various teams/organizations (eg. EAO, BUaaS, Engineering, CloudOps, etc.) on a Windows OS layer of customer SAP server. Any credential less authentication (like SSO/SAML/Kerberos/other certificate or token) access to a SAP level (NetWeaver, EP, Fiori, etc) by customer individuals have to be configured on the SAP level pointing to a customer own or other directory services (Active Directory, LDAP, etc) but cannot point to the AD created by P4S for a customer.

Platform as a Service for SAP on GCP: The GCP acronym stands for Google Public Cloud. The first release (1.0) will be Sales Ready by the end of November 2018 and will be based on “Remote Services for SAP Release 2.0”. The “Remote Services for SAP” offering name has been retired and is no longer being marketed or sold. In the second release (PaaS for SAP on GCP 2.0) the “Remote Services for SAP Release 2.0” technology will be replaced by PaaS for SAP automation. In the first release, DXC does not have the capability to resell the GCP IaaS Services. SFDC entry directions: Discontinue using “Remote Services for SAP” as an SFDC code. If your client is not “on Premise” use Platform as a Service for SAP on GCP as the SFDC code.

The additional discounts are applicable only when they go through DXC. If the deal is Qualified as P4S on AWS , ensure that the Sales/Opportunity Owner has registered the opportunity with DXC-AWS Integrated Practice to avail approved discounts and is a MUST before P4S Solutioner is engaged. The Opportunity can be registered using the following link :         https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/awsIntegrated/SitePages/AWS%20Integrated%20Practice.aspx. If the deal is Qualified as P4S on Azure , ensure that SLMS is engaged for better discounts .For more information on SLMS , refer the link below https://whatwesell.dxc.com/dxc/offerings/software-licensing-and-management-solutions/vendors/microsoft/. Engage ECA OSA additionally if you identify that this has potential Functional SAP Component or Functional Migration , in particular S/4 HANA opportunities. Look for Cost Optimization through leveraging On demand (PAYG) and RI ( Reserved Instances) efficiently . PAYG(Eg: 8x5 Operations) is cost generally viable for Non production environment that needs to be used only for limited period of the day(40 hrs a week) while production environments are generally RI (24x7 Operations). Ensure that a Network Solutioner is available to design the external connectivity Solution including any Non standard networking requests. AT&T should be involved for such solution requiements Ensure a security Solutioner is available for any specific compliance needs and additional security requirements beyond the standard native security componets proposed within the PaaS solution Moving to Cloud is not really about Price reduction as main benefit but rather about bringing flexibility and agility to the way they operate today and for them to tackle new business opportunities.

PaaS for SAP on AWS or PaaS for SAP on Azure) for T&T migration, Basis, BUaaS and managed AWS or Azure Scenario #2 – PaaS services sold by DXC AND Public Cloud sold by Public Cloud vendor (EA or Microsoft Customer Agreement) => One code: 1. PaaS for SAP on AWS or PaaS for SAP on Azure or PaaS for SAP on GCP for T&T migration, Basis, BUaaS and managed AWS or Azure Scenario #3 – Fully Custom managed SAP platform services sold by DXC => One or Two codes: 1. PaaS for SAP Basis Services 2. AWS or Azure or Google Cloud Services (ONLY IF DXC IS RESELLING THE PUBLIC CLOUD SERVICES) If you don’t know if the solution will be custom or standard, then code it as per the cloud it is planned to run on e.g. PaaS for SAP on AWS or PaaS for SAP on Azure or PaaS for SAP on GCP or PaaS for SAP on Premises and it can be recoded later on to PaaS for SAP Basis Services if it is determined that it has to be solutioned and delivered as custom. In general, responsibility for SAP Upgrades/Updates and Workload Migrations to managed IaaS and traditional infrastructure are as follows (Revenue distribution will be allocated in proportion to the offerings sold) : -ECA is responsible for functional and data conversion and migration -CPS is responsible for technical migration. This includes SAP OS/DB migration Note that SFDC opportunities must include all offering families with the correct allocation of revenue and margin, Revenue coding guidelines. For this SAP business it means you need to probably include Cloud and Platform Services offerings as well as Enterprise Cloud Applications offerings depending on customer scenario regardless of the SFDC sales owner, region or industry. Key is to maximize upsell of the entire SAP compound offering set. Accordingly when selling within a specific sales campaign e.g. “Ignite” then include each offering picked within the sales.

Key Takeaways DXC can resell Azure under CSP with potential for margin and incentives Customer who has Microsoft EA may add Azure to that EA or procure from DXC under CSP If customer has an EA, DXC can earn incentives and recognition from Microsoft for the Azure consumption. To earn these your customer must nominate DXC as Digital Partner of Record (DPOR) Contact the licensing experts within DXC from Software Licensing & Management Solutions (SLMS) for licensing & DPOR related support Provides client with single point of contact for services & Azure subscriptions No upfront commitment – Pay-as-you-go – except for Reserved Instances (RI) CSP partner must offer support services CSP reseller sets end-client price RI discount available under CSP GSI enhanced program Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Typically Microsoft Direct (indirect allowed by exception/in certain countries) Client >500+ seats typically have EA for desktop but can opt to include/exclude CSP Requires upfront Azure commitment Invoiced annually upfront Use it or lose it model for Azure Retail price for new EA (custom discounting)  Enterprise Agreement (EA) Evergreen agreement No Partner involvement Direct countries at launch March/April 19 Azure-only commercial clients at launch Invoiced monthly initially but will be expanded in MS FY20 to include upfront commitment & custom T&C options  Microsoft Customer Agreement October 4, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential There are predominantly 2 ways a customer can license or acquire Azure –through an Enterprise agreement with Microsoft or from DXC through the Cloud Solution provider program Under CSP, DXC can earn margin on the Azure resale while still offering discount on Retail to end-customer. DXC can also earn incentives from the revenue we put through this program CSP enables DXC to put the Azure revenue through our books and be a cost-effective way for customers to acquire Azure so we should always lead with CSP. It is a strategic program within DXC with exec sponsorship and we have one of the largest CSP global footprint of any partner Microsoft make available a wealth of incentives for CSP which are many and varied and so it is absolutely critical that the team engage with the right Azure Solutioning team first to build out the Bill of materials and then with the SLMS team to apply CSP pricing from our Strategic partnership agreement and evaluate the incentive levers that apply. For those customers who have an EA with Azure is critical that we mandate that our customers nominate DXC as the Digital Partner of Record for the Azure subscriptions so we get recognition as the partner that has influenced consumption and that we earn incentives from Microsoft There is a licensing practise within DXC that can support account teams on Azure licensing, the DXC offerings for Azure and the Digital Partner of Record process 79 DXC- An authorized Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Partner AMERICAS EU-EFTA (Direct & Indirect) APAC  CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY Brazil USD Austria Germany Malta EURO Denmark DKK Australia AUD New Zealand NZD Canada CAD Belgium Greece Netherlands Norway NOK Hong Kong HKD Malaysia USD USA USD Bulgaria Hungary Poland Sweden SEK Japan JPY Singapore USD Chile USD Croatia Iceland Portugal Switzerland CHF Korea KRW Taiwan TWD Mexico USD Cyprus Ireland Romania UK GBP India INR Thailand USD USA – Azure Gov Cloud USD Czech Rep.

Go through the Readiness Checklist 2. Issues List Updates 3. Discuss questions on the Email from Dean Norris Luisito - Collecting the information for the BUR Hamzi - following up on the BUR training Jakub to check with Susane on the FRUN access Campbell 1. I don’t believe that Campbell’s would ever consider moving any of the SAP servers to a separate Azure Subscription.  That would be a battle for DXC SAP/EAO team to approach Campbell’s if they desired such a change) Will Campbell be moving to a separate subscription once we move the support from CloudOps to Eao? 2. Any VM’s which CloudOps supports must have the OMS Agent and standard Managed Services for Azure (MS4A) Monitoring running. What will happen in the OMS that is currently running?  3. There is no model where CloudOps shares the infrastructure support with the Client or other DXC teams. There are numerous reasons but having a single team working from a single monitoring/ticketing process. The Infrastructure Monitoring and OS Support is either CloudOps or if another group supports it- they support it entirely. EAO Platform will support ENTIRELY? 5. All alerts for system monitoring - via OMS (CPU/MEMORY/DISK ) Action Groups/Alerts configured do generate tickets and the MS4A Offering does not have the functionality for shifting these alerts to any other team’s ServiceNow Queue. CloudOps is not a service desk and will not route tickets to other teams. What will happen in the OMS alerts that is going to SERVICE NOW? Will thae be replaced by FRUN and SNOW? 7. DXC SAP EAO BASIS admins should verify that all SAP VM’s have the latest working Start/Stop Scripts for the SAP Applications and Oracle DB’s running on those Servers so in the event of any servers are ever rebooted/restarted/shutdown. If it is chosen that no Startup/Shutdown Scripts are installed in the Start/Stop Sequences which can occur in unplanned outages then those should be clearly documented Do we have the scripts ready for install? 8. Campbell’s has a very structured Patching Cycle for all Devices, including the Oracle Linux VM’s which are running SAP. The DXC SAP EAO team should have a clear understanding of the Campbell’s process and if the DXC SAP EAO team has any concerns with the Campbells’ patching process they need to address those directly with Campbell’s and include CloudOps as CloudOps will be performing the Oracle Linux Patching. technically all Patching will be done ny EAO except for the VM What are the types of Patching?  f. Be trained / proficient at Azure Site Recovery(ASR) as the Production SAP servers are configured with ASR and any planned DR Test or Real DR Event will be the responsibility of the team that managed the OS/Infrastructure. g. Have ownership of all SAP VM’s backups – Azure Native Backups and any other Backup solution (CommVault) which meets the requirements which they need to utilize to perform backup and restores for the SAP VM’s. EAO Platform or BUR to support Azure backup? i. Complete a Design doc which encompasses all parts of support of the SAP VM’s not just the SAP EAO team’s SAP App and DB, but all aspects of their support for Azure (Deployment/Provisioning, Monitoring, ticketing, backup/restore, patching, security, Redundancy, ASR, contacts, escalations, Access (add System admin/del system admin) Those documents are not OD&T’s or CloudOps, they need to entirely EAO SAP Team ownership. Do we have existing documents for SAP VMs Provisioning Deployment Incident Management Backup and Restore Patching Security Redundancy ASR Access (add System admin/del system admin) j. Have worked with the DXC Managed Services for Azure (MS4A) – Offering Leadership – aka – Mark Fowler and have an agreement with any financial adjustments/recording keeping/tracking/reporting/billing/cloudcheckr changes that would occur based on the intended support changes. Who need to work this out? l. Removal of OMS/Log Analytics extension and connection to the MS4A workspace Who need to work this out? m. Installation of FocusRun monitoring Agent.

On an exception case a customer service user with limited access rights can be created to support special requirements like access file-share interface hosted in P4S by customer. The P4S Windows IAM (Identity Access Management) aims to provide centralized, unified, secure and scalable user access management for DXC support people from various teams/organizations (eg. EAO, BUaaS, Engineering, CloudOps, etc.) on a Windows OS layer of customer SAP server. Any credential less authentication (like SSO/SAML/Kerberos/other certificate or token) access to a SAP level (NetWeaver, EP, Fiori, etc) by customer individuals have to be configured on the SAP level pointing to a customer own or other directory services (Active Directory, LDAP, etc) but cannot point to the AD created by P4S for a customer.

Platform as a Service for SAP on GCP: The GCP acronym stands for Google Public Cloud. The first release (1.0) will be Sales Ready by the end of November 2018 and will be based on “Remote Services for SAP Release 2.0”. The “Remote Services for SAP” offering name has been retired and is no longer being marketed or sold. In the second release (PaaS for SAP on GCP 2.0) the “Remote Services for SAP Release 2.0” technology will be replaced by PaaS for SAP automation. In the first release, DXC does not have the capability to resell the GCP IaaS Services. SFDC entry directions: Discontinue using “Remote Services for SAP” as an SFDC code. If your client is not “on Premise” use Platform as a Service for SAP on GCP as the SFDC code.

The additional discounts are applicable only when they go through DXC. If the deal is Qualified as P4S on AWS , ensure that the Sales/Opportunity Owner has registered the opportunity with DXC-AWS Integrated Practice to avail approved discounts and is a MUST before P4S Solutioner is engaged. The Opportunity can be registered using the following link :         https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/awsIntegrated/SitePages/AWS%20Integrated%20Practice.aspx. If the deal is Qualified as P4S on Azure , ensure that SLMS is engaged for better discounts .For more information on SLMS , refer the link below https://whatwesell.dxc.com/dxc/offerings/software-licensing-and-management-solutions/vendors/microsoft/. Engage ECA OSA additionally if you identify that this has potential Functional SAP Component or Functional Migration , in particular S/4 HANA opportunities. Look for Cost Optimization through leveraging On demand (PAYG) and RI ( Reserved Instances) efficiently . PAYG(Eg: 8x5 Operations) is cost generally viable for Non production environment that needs to be used only for limited period of the day(40 hrs a week) while production environments are generally RI (24x7 Operations). Ensure that a Network Solutioner is available to design the external connectivity Solution including any Non standard networking requests. AT&T should be involved for such solution requiements Ensure a security Solutioner is available for any specific compliance needs and additional security requirements beyond the standard native security componets proposed within the PaaS solution Moving to Cloud is not really about Price reduction as main benefit but rather about bringing flexibility and agility to the way they operate today and for them to tackle new business opportunities.

PaaS for SAP on AWS or PaaS for SAP on Azure) for T&T migration, Basis, BUaaS and managed AWS or Azure Scenario #2 – PaaS services sold by DXC AND Public Cloud sold by Public Cloud vendor (EA or Microsoft Customer Agreement) => One code: 1. PaaS for SAP on AWS or PaaS for SAP on Azure or PaaS for SAP on GCP for T&T migration, Basis, BUaaS and managed AWS or Azure Scenario #3 – Fully Custom managed SAP platform services sold by DXC => One or Two codes: 1. PaaS for SAP Basis Services 2. AWS or Azure or Google Cloud Services (ONLY IF DXC IS RESELLING THE PUBLIC CLOUD SERVICES) If you don’t know if the solution will be custom or standard, then code it as per the cloud it is planned to run on e.g. PaaS for SAP on AWS or PaaS for SAP on Azure or PaaS for SAP on GCP or PaaS for SAP on Premises and it can be recoded later on to PaaS for SAP Basis Services if it is determined that it has to be solutioned and delivered as custom. In general, responsibility for SAP Upgrades/Updates and Workload Migrations to managed IaaS and traditional infrastructure are as follows (Revenue distribution will be allocated in proportion to the offerings sold) : -ECA is responsible for functional and data conversion and migration -CPS is responsible for technical migration. This includes SAP OS/DB migration Note that SFDC opportunities must include all offering families with the correct allocation of revenue and margin, Revenue coding guidelines. For this SAP business it means you need to probably include Cloud and Platform Services offerings as well as Enterprise Cloud Applications offerings depending on customer scenario regardless of the SFDC sales owner, region or industry. Key is to maximize upsell of the entire SAP compound offering set. Accordingly when selling within a specific sales campaign e.g. “Ignite” then include each offering picked within the sales.

Key Takeaways DXC can resell Azure under CSP with potential for margin and incentives Customer who has Microsoft EA may add Azure to that EA or procure from DXC under CSP If customer has an EA, DXC can earn incentives and recognition from Microsoft for the Azure consumption. To earn these your customer must nominate DXC as Digital Partner of Record (DPOR) Contact the licensing experts within DXC from Software Licensing & Management Solutions (SLMS) for licensing & DPOR related support Provides client with single point of contact for services & Azure subscriptions No upfront commitment – Pay-as-you-go – except for Reserved Instances (RI) CSP partner must offer support services CSP reseller sets end-client price RI discount available under CSP GSI enhanced program Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Typically Microsoft Direct (indirect allowed by exception/in certain countries) Client >500+ seats typically have EA for desktop but can opt to include/exclude CSP Requires upfront Azure commitment Invoiced annually upfront Use it or lose it model for Azure Retail price for new EA (custom discounting)  Enterprise Agreement (EA) Evergreen agreement No Partner involvement Direct countries at launch March/April 19 Azure-only commercial clients at launch Invoiced monthly initially but will be expanded in MS FY20 to include upfront commitment & custom T&C options  Microsoft Customer Agreement October 4, 2019 ‹#› DXC Proprietary and Confidential There are predominantly 2 ways a customer can license or acquire Azure –through an Enterprise agreement with Microsoft or from DXC through the Cloud Solution provider program Under CSP, DXC can earn margin on the Azure resale while still offering discount on Retail to end-customer. DXC can also earn incentives from the revenue we put through this program CSP enables DXC to put the Azure revenue through our books and be a cost-effective way for customers to acquire Azure so we should always lead with CSP. It is a strategic program within DXC with exec sponsorship and we have one of the largest CSP global footprint of any partner Microsoft make available a wealth of incentives for CSP which are many and varied and so it is absolutely critical that the team engage with the right Azure Solutioning team first to build out the Bill of materials and then with the SLMS team to apply CSP pricing from our Strategic partnership agreement and evaluate the incentive levers that apply. For those customers who have an EA with Azure is critical that we mandate that our customers nominate DXC as the Digital Partner of Record for the Azure subscriptions so we get recognition as the partner that has influenced consumption and that we earn incentives from Microsoft There is a licensing practise within DXC that can support account teams on Azure licensing, the DXC offerings for Azure and the Digital Partner of Record process 79 DXC- An authorized Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Partner AMERICAS EU-EFTA (Direct & Indirect) APAC  CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY CONTRACT LOCATION MS BILLING CURRENCY Brazil USD Austria Germany Malta EURO Denmark DKK Australia AUD New Zealand NZD Canada CAD Belgium Greece Netherlands Norway NOK Hong Kong HKD Malaysia USD USA USD Bulgaria Hungary Poland Sweden SEK Japan JPY Singapore USD Chile USD Croatia Iceland Portugal Switzerland CHF Korea KRW Taiwan TWD Mexico USD Cyprus Ireland Romania UK GBP India INR Thailand USD USA – Azure Gov Cloud USD Czech Rep.

Go through the Readiness Checklist 2. Issues List Updates 3. Discuss questions on the Email from Dean Norris Luisito - Collecting the information for the BUR Hamzi - following up on the BUR training Jakub to check with Susane on the FRUN access Campbell 1. I don’t believe that Campbell’s would ever consider moving any of the SAP servers to a separate Azure Subscription.  That would be a battle for DXC SAP/EAO team to approach Campbell’s if they desired such a change) Will Campbell be moving to a separate subscription once we move the support from CloudOps to Eao? 2. Any VM’s which CloudOps supports must have the OMS Agent and standard Managed Services for Azure (MS4A) Monitoring running. What will happen in the OMS that is currently running?  3. There is no model where CloudOps shares the infrastructure support with the Client or other DXC teams. There are numerous reasons but having a single team working from a single monitoring/ticketing process. The Infrastructure Monitoring and OS Support is either CloudOps or if another group supports it- they support it entirely. EAO Platform will support ENTIRELY? 5. All alerts for system monitoring - via OMS (CPU/MEMORY/DISK ) Action Groups/Alerts configured do generate tickets and the MS4A Offering does not have the functionality for shifting these alerts to any other team’s ServiceNow Queue. CloudOps is not a service desk and will not route tickets to other teams. What will happen in the OMS alerts that is going to SERVICE NOW? Will thae be replaced by FRUN and SNOW? 7. DXC SAP EAO BASIS admins should verify that all SAP VM’s have the latest working Start/Stop Scripts for the SAP Applications and Oracle DB’s running on those Servers so in the event of any servers are ever rebooted/restarted/shutdown. If it is chosen that no Startup/Shutdown Scripts are installed in the Start/Stop Sequences which can occur in unplanned outages then those should be clearly documented Do we have the scripts ready for install? 8. Campbell’s has a very structured Patching Cycle for all Devices, including the Oracle Linux VM’s which are running SAP. The DXC SAP EAO team should have a clear understanding of the Campbell’s process and if the DXC SAP EAO team has any concerns with the Campbells’ patching process they need to address those directly with Campbell’s and include CloudOps as CloudOps will be performing the Oracle Linux Patching. technically all Patching will be done ny EAO except for the VM What are the types of Patching?  f. Be trained / proficient at Azure Site Recovery(ASR) as the Production SAP servers are configured with ASR and any planned DR Test or Real DR Event will be the responsibility of the team that managed the OS/Infrastructure. g. Have ownership of all SAP VM’s backups – Azure Native Backups and any other Backup solution (CommVault) which meets the requirements which they need to utilize to perform backup and restores for the SAP VM’s. EAO Platform or BUR to support Azure backup? i. Complete a Design doc which encompasses all parts of support of the SAP VM’s not just the SAP EAO team’s SAP App and DB, but all aspects of their support for Azure (Deployment/Provisioning, Monitoring, ticketing, backup/restore, patching, security, Redundancy, ASR, contacts, escalations, Access (add System admin/del system admin) Those documents are not OD&T’s or CloudOps, they need to entirely EAO SAP Team ownership. Do we have existing documents for SAP VMs Provisioning Deployment Incident Management Backup and Restore Patching Security Redundancy ASR Access (add System admin/del system admin) j. Have worked with the DXC Managed Services for Azure (MS4A) – Offering Leadership – aka – Mark Fowler and have an agreement with any financial adjustments/recording keeping/tracking/reporting/billing/cloudcheckr changes that would occur based on the intended support changes. Who need to work this out? l. Removal of OMS/Log Analytics extension and connection to the MS4A workspace Who need to work this out? m. Installation of FocusRun monitoring Agent.

IT wants to improve productivity and employee engagement through providing users with an innovative consumer-like work experience, but to maintain security and compliance. Users want a work experience similar to what they get on their smartphones with the flexibility to use whatever device best suits their immediate needs. In general, everyone would like a step up in innovation and user experience with a step down in cost. Need to attract, retain, and engage employees Enterprises are struggling to attract and retain employees and to drive productivity through user IT. Satisfying user expectations, however, is difficult given limited IT budgets and the contrast between work and consumer IT experiences. 85% of employees globally are not engaged or are actively disengaged at work.1 5-6% average increase in enterprise-wide productivity when people are engaged through IT.5 73% of employers are having a difficult time finding skilled candidates.2 53% of Millennials would be more likely to accept a job if the employer used the same technologies they do.6 Workers at technology laggards  450% more likely to want to leave to go work elsewhere compared to workers at technology leaders.4 46% of the time, users are frustrated by their PC usage.3 <=30% productivity gain for employees from collaboration technology.7 75% of enterprises report that IoT has increased productivity.8 Challenge: A medical supply company wanted to better handle urgent and sensitive IT support requirements and drive improved user satisfaction Business outcomes: • The company deployed a digital support solution from DXC including automated proactive support, walk-in centers, a self-service portal, chat, as well as more traditional on-site and service desk support. • User satisfaction scores increased to an average of 90 plus percent and support costs were significantly cut. Challenge: A global biopharmaceutical company wanted to upgrade employee experience and productivity, meet security and compliance needs, and provide an integrated, end-to-end solution to ensure strong deployment and support Business outcomes: • DXC deployed and supported an Office 365 solution including Exchange, Skype for Business, SharePoint, and Yammer to 32,000 employees resulting in improved collaboration and productivity. • The solution produced an estimated 27% cost savings. Return on investment—how do you measure value? Analyst key findings X By 2020, organizations that support a choose your own workstyle (CYOW) culture will boost employee retention rates by more than 10%.9 X Enterprises aspire to upgrade and transform the workplace environment to not only equip existing employees, but also to attract new talent.10 X The [first two] key decision factors in selecting a vendor to deliver digital workplace services are: • Providing end-users a greater choice of engagement and more personalized service support across the workplace through proactive and predictive …, self–serve …, on-site (tech cafes, smart lockers and IT vending machines). • Accelerating the adoption of cloud-based capabilities (Device as a Service, Windows 10, 0365, VDI, Workspace as a Service, Skype for Business and UCaaS)11 X Many enterprises are mislead into adopting a workplace service model based on user productivity—camouflaged as user experience. As a result, current workplace offerings provide short-term productivity gains at the cost of the employee’s wellness, happiness, and morale. Enterprises, it is time to humanize the workplace experience.12 Employee experience drives productivity The good news is that research shows that digital workplaces, when correctly deployed, can attract employees, significantly increase employee engagement and productivity, and help retain those employees—all while actually reducing costs.

What do you think could enhance it? • How do you view the security of your mobility and bring-your-own-device environment? • Are your users taking full advantage of Office 365, Teams, and other new collaboration technologies? • What are you doing to align workplace costs with usage? • How do you see wearables, augmented reality, and IoT helping you achieve productivity improvements? • Where do you stand with your move to Windows 10 and are you handling it as yet-another Microsoft operating system or as a transformational opportunity? • What projects do you have for using mobility, wearables, and augmented reality to support new operational or business models? • Are you looking at ways to measure or quantify the employee experience? • What workplace projects do you have for front-line workers (those who work directly and primarily with your customers as opposed to knowledge workers)? Conversation starters Key deal data points Deal characteristics • Implementation: Typical sales cycle of 1 year and transformation of 2-3 years. Small, single-aspect deals can have sales cycle of a couple months. • Deal Size: Varies based on services provided. Target clients range from 1,000 to 200,000 seats. • Regions: Global/regional companies in all industries. • Target clients will be looking for a great employee experience, an employee-centric digital workplace, etc. Lowering costs should be secondary. • For old DXC clients with a traditional solution, we may need to make a clean break from the past in order to establish credibility. Proof points • DXC is #1 in market share for digital workplace. We are double the size of most of our closest competitors. (NelsonHall, 2019) • DXC has been listed as a “leader” in categories including Digital Workplace Services, Managed Workplace Services, Workplace Services, and IoT Services by Gartner, IDC, ISG, Nelson Hall, and Everest • DXC has over 1100 workplace clients and manages endpoint devices for over 8.8 million employees • DXC provides support services in 56 languages • 600+ managed cloud clients and 1200+ private cloud installations worldwide • 50,000+ applications professionals worldwide Typical questions from the client Q. Your competitors claim the same differentiators as you do. Are you really different? A. YES! They cannot claim all of the same differentiators as we do without lying. The only published market share data for digital workplace services is from NelsonHall, Advanced Digital Workplace Services, Feb. 2019. It shows DXC with a 19.3% market share, Atos with 14.2%, Fujitsu with 6.9%, and everyone else lower. DXC’s position is commanding. Similarly, no other vendor offers as many personalized support options as does DXC. Q. What is DXC MyWorkStyle? A. DXC used to offer a persona-based set of workplace offerings that divided employees into five categories and served them by category. Today we have personalized the workplace experience so each employee can have their own experience based on their needs and wants. Effectively, DXC MyWorkStyle is DXC’s brand name for digital workplace, but it also reflects our vision of what an ideal digital workplace should be. 5 Wins & Competition 6-7 Industries 8 More Good Stuff1 What’s Inside 2 Level Setting 3 Approach Plan 4 Partners & Roles 3 Identify what clients need: • Drive productivity and employee engagement, and attract/retain talent • Provide employees with an innovative, consumer-like work experience • Disruptive operational & business models based on mobility, augmented reality, and IoT • Convenient, easy-to-use support experience tuned to individual needs • More for less: Step up in innovation, automation, and experience at a lower cost DXC Internal Use Only Involve expert resources Find the recommended resources shown below to support your Sales pursuit on WWS here: Plan your approach useful links Gain a greater understanding using: • GTM Competitive Intelligence assets • HeatMaps to explore account penetration and opportunities Find answers to specific questions using: • Sales Information Centre, which provides support via the Front Door • Industry Intelligence in which you can find industry- specific information • Experts on the SPOKES platform Use key DXC strategies to establish engagements: • QuickStarts • Market Pricing Reference Desk • Salesforce.com • Product Knowledge Center • Online research tools https://whatwesell.dxc.com/dxc/processes/certified-digital-collateral/plan-approach-useful-links/ https://whatwesell.dxc.com/dxc/processes/certified-digital-collateral/plan-approach-useful-links/ Improved productivity and employee engagement Employee engagement comes from “employee experience”, that is the employees’ cultural, physical, and technological environment.

IT wants to improve productivity and employee engagement through providing users with an innovative consumer-like work experience, but to maintain security and compliance. Users want a work experience similar to what they get on their smartphones with the flexibility to use whatever device best suits their immediate needs. In general, everyone would like a step up in innovation and user experience with a step down in cost. Need to attract, retain, and engage employees Enterprises are struggling to attract and retain employees and to drive productivity through user IT. Satisfying user expectations, however, is difficult given limited IT budgets and the contrast between work and consumer IT experiences. 85% of employees globally are not engaged or are actively disengaged at work.1 5-6% average increase in enterprise-wide productivity when people are engaged through IT.5 73% of employers are having a difficult time finding skilled candidates.2 53% of Millennials would be more likely to accept a job if the employer used the same technologies they do.6 Workers at technology laggards  450% more likely to want to leave to go work elsewhere compared to workers at technology leaders.4 46% of the time, users are frustrated by their PC usage.3 <=30% productivity gain for employees from collaboration technology.7 75% of enterprises report that IoT has increased productivity.8 Challenge: A medical supply company wanted to better handle urgent and sensitive IT support requirements and drive improved user satisfaction Business outcomes: • The company deployed a digital support solution from DXC including automated proactive support, walk-in centers, a self-service portal, chat, as well as more traditional on-site and service desk support. • User satisfaction scores increased to an average of 90 plus percent and support costs were significantly cut. Challenge: A global biopharmaceutical company wanted to upgrade employee experience and productivity, meet security and compliance needs, and provide an integrated, end-to-end solution to ensure strong deployment and support Business outcomes: • DXC deployed and supported an Office 365 solution including Exchange, Skype for Business, SharePoint, and Yammer to 32,000 employees resulting in improved collaboration and productivity. • The solution produced an estimated 27% cost savings. Return on investment—how do you measure value? Analyst key findings X By 2020, organizations that support a choose your own workstyle (CYOW) culture will boost employee retention rates by more than 10%.9 X Enterprises aspire to upgrade and transform the workplace environment to not only equip existing employees, but also to attract new talent.10 X The [first two] key decision factors in selecting a vendor to deliver digital workplace services are: • Providing end-users a greater choice of engagement and more personalized service support across the workplace through proactive and predictive …, self–serve …, on-site (tech cafes, smart lockers and IT vending machines). • Accelerating the adoption of cloud-based capabilities (Device as a Service, Windows 10, 0365, VDI, Workspace as a Service, Skype for Business and UCaaS)11 X Many enterprises are mislead into adopting a workplace service model based on user productivity—camouflaged as user experience. As a result, current workplace offerings provide short-term productivity gains at the cost of the employee’s wellness, happiness, and morale. Enterprises, it is time to humanize the workplace experience.12 Employee experience drives productivity The good news is that research shows that digital workplaces, when correctly deployed, can attract employees, significantly increase employee engagement and productivity, and help retain those employees—all while actually reducing costs.

It shows DXC with a 19.3% market share, Atos with 14.2%, Fujitsu with 6.9%, and everyone else lower. DXC’s position is commanding. Similarly, no other vendor offers as many personalized support options as does DXC. Q. What is DXC MyWorkStyle? A. DXC used to offer a persona-based set of workplace offerings that divided employees into five categories and served them by category. Today we have personalized the workplace experience so each employee can have their own experience based on their needs and wants. Effectively, DXC MyWorkStyle is DXC’s brand name for digital workplace, but it also reflects our vision of what an ideal digital workplace should be. 5 Wins & Competition 6-7 Industries 8 More Good Stuff1 What’s Inside 2 Level Setting 3 Approach Plan 4 Partners & Roles 3 Identify what clients need: • Drive productivity and employee engagement, and attract/retain talent • Provide employees with an innovative, consumer-like work experience • Disruptive operational & business models based on mobility, augmented reality, and IoT • Convenient, easy-to-use support experience tuned to individual needs • More for less: Step up in innovation, automation, and experience at a lower cost DXC Internal Use Only Involve expert resources Find the recommended resources shown below to support your Sales pursuit on WWS here: Plan your approach useful links Gain a greater understanding using: • GTM Competitive Intelligence assets • HeatMaps to explore account penetration and opportunities Find answers to specific questions using: • Sales Information Centre, which provides support via the Front Door • Industry Intelligence in which you can find industry- specific information • Experts on the SPOKES platform Use key DXC strategies to establish engagements: • QuickStarts • Market Pricing Reference Desk • Salesforce.com • Product Knowledge Center • Online research tools https://whatwesell.dxc.com/dxc/processes/certified-digital-collateral/plan-approach-useful-links/ https://whatwesell.dxc.com/dxc/processes/certified-digital-collateral/plan-approach-useful-links/ Improved productivity and employee engagement Employee engagement comes from “employee experience”, that is the employees’ cultural, physical, and technological environment.

Many offerings lack needed functionality. Too much time is still spent on administrative tasks rather the strategic support of the organization. Organizations understand the reasons for moving to the cloud but lack a plan to move forward. Assistance from outside sources, such as DXC, is needed to help move clients forward. HR strategy and execution Business and workforce changes show it’s time use HR not just as the system of record, but as the hub where everything comes together to transform the work experience and manage the workforce. Organizational readiness Many clients lack organizational readiness to achieve their required process transformation. Key barriers to successful implementation of the cloud include removing legacy customizations and accepting the delivered functionality required for software as a service (SaaS).

Many offerings lack needed functionality. Too much time is still spent on administrative tasks rather the strategic support of the organization. Organizations understand the reasons for moving to the cloud but lack a plan to move forward. Assistance from outside sources, such as DXC, is needed to help move clients forward. HR strategy and execution Business and workforce changes show it’s time use HR not just as the system of record, but as the hub where everything comes together to transform the work experience and manage the workforce.

Pursuit Launch uses Microsoft (MS) Planner Boards enriched with continuously updated data from DXC’s Salestorce.com and Enterprise Data Lake to enable Pod teams to quickly assess and prioritize the key opportunities in their industry or territory segments. Pursuit Launch has three main components. The first component is a “Pipeline Board” that includes all Sales Stages 1-5 Open opportunities grouped into “buckets” based on Deal Category. All Pipeline Boards have Category A, B, C and On Hold buckets by default. Some regions have additional buckets based on their business needs, such as such as Category D or Small Deals.  Figure 1 – Sample Pipeline Planner Board (UKIIMEA Insurance segment) that visualizes Category A, B and Category C pipeline opportunities.  The second Pursuit Launch component is an “Active Board” of inflight opportunities that the industry/territory Pod teams are actively working through APF or are providing significant “Role Based’ support.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 5 of 23      Figure 2 – Sample Active Planner Board (Americas Technology, Media, and Telecommunications segment) that visualizes opportunities actively being supported through APF.  Finally, there is a Pursuit Launch List View that provides additional SalesForce.com details on all opportunities and enables certain administrative tasks.  Figure 3 – Sample Pursuit Launch List View which provides additional data on each opportunity, including filtering and search capabilities, and supports key administrative tasks.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 6 of 23 Note that while Pursuit Launch leverages the same MS Planner Boards used by many DXC teams, there are some key differences to the standard MS functionality. Tasks in the Pursuit Launch Planner Boards are driven by automation; therefore, typical manual changes used for other boards cannot be used. • Do not manually create new Tasks in these boards. • Do not manually edit the name of a Task or the Task Description. It is also important that you do not delete any buckets from the boards because several of the predefined buckets are necessary to support automation, and additional automation functionality may be deployed in the future. Check with your Region Pursuit Launch Board Owner and the Pursuit Launch team before making any structural changes to the boards.  See the following sections for additional details on the Pipeline Boards, Active Boards, and Pursuit Launch List View.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 7 of 23 2.0 Pipeline Board Overview  The Pipeline Board includes Task cards for each open sales opportunity in Sales Stages 1-5. The Pipeline Boards are structured by Deal Category buckets with opportunities automatically populated into buckets for Deal Category A-C (some regions have additional category buckets based on business need). The sorting of opportunities into buckets is based on a combination of the Opportunity TOV in US$, and the Deal Category code in Salesforce.com (SFDC). The Deal Category code takes precedence. For example, an opportunity with a Deal Category Code of “B” that is below $20M US$ will be included in the Category B bucket). To appear in the board, opportunities must be in Sales Stage 1-5, have at least one offering selected in Salesforce.com, and have appropriate Industry/Territory and Sub-Region 3 identifiers in Salesforce. In addition, note that opportunities that were created in Salesforce prior to Jan. 1, 2019, are not automatically posted to the Pipeline Board. Older opportunities can be pulled into the Pipeline Board by selecting them in the Pursuit Launch List View as detailed in Section 3 of this document.  Figure 4 – Sample Pipeline Board for NCE Switzerland territory (includes Category D bucket due to small deal focus in this territory).  Important! Sales Opportunities must meet the following criteria to automatically appear on the Pipeline Board: • Sales Stage 1-5 Open (cannot be “Won”, “Lost” or “DXC Not Pursued”) • At least one offering is selected in Salesforce.com • Created in Salesforce.com after Jan. 1, 2019 (older opportunities can be added manually as detailed in Section 3 of this Guide) • The opportunity must be created correctly in Salesforce.com with appropriate Industry/Territory and Sub-Region 3 values  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 8 of 23 2.1 Key Pipeline Board Features & Functions  Opportunity Task Cards Task cards are automatically created for all opportunities in the Pipeline Board. Key Salesforce.com details are prepopulated in the Task Description so that you can quickly assess the scope and maturity of an opportunity. Where appropriate, you are encouraged to reach out proactively to opportunity owners for early engagement and Deal Shaping. As shown below, you may find it beneficial to use the comments field to track these interactions. You can assign multiple people to a task. People who are assigned will get notified of new comments. You may also choose to set a due date if there are agreed timeframes for further actions. When the due date is reached, the date will turn red on the card. The card also contains a direct link to the opportunity in Salesforce.com, and a link to the Pursuit Launch List View (see subsequent sections of this document for details on using List View).  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 9 of 23  Figure 5 – Click on a Task Card to see Salesforce.com details, add comments, or set a due date. As shown above with the yellow highlights, you are encouraged to use the Comments field to track your status, actions and team inputs. Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 10 of 23  KEY FEATURE - Moving Pipeline Tasks to the Active Board When an opportunity has matured to the point that it needs to go through APF, or needs significant Role Based support, it is time to elevate it from the Pipeline Board to the Active Board. This is done by changing a Pipeline Task’s “Progress” setting to “Completed” (illustrated below). This will trigger automated creation of a corresponding Task in the Backlog Bucket of the Active Board. The new task should appear in the Active Board in about one to two minutes. Figure 6 – Marking a Task Completed on the Pipeline Board automatically creates a corresponding task on the Active Board. Take care not to mark Tasks as Completed until you are certain the Pod team intends to support it. On the main Pipeline Planner Board view, Completed Tasks will still be accessible at the bottom of each bucket by expanding the “Show Completed” drop-down arrow (see Figure 4).  Completed Tasks can be deleted when they are no longer useful to you or your team. It is suggested that these tasks remain in the completed section of the board for a few days. This allows someone on your team who is looking for that Task to see that is has been promoted to the Active Board). Avoid accidently deleting Pipeline Tasks that have not been marked Completed. Tasks that are accidently deleted from the board can only be restored to the Pipeline Board by selecting them in the Pursuit Launch List View (as detailed in Section 3 of this document). Conversely, if there are opportunities on your board that you are certain will not be supported in the future, you can choose to delete them from your board. If the situation changes, you can recreate those Tasks using the Pursuit Launch List View. Important! Do not make comments in the Description field as you might do in other Planner Boards. Pursuit Launch makes automated updates to the Salesforce.com details in the Description field, which will overwrite/eliminate your comments.  Instead, use the Comments field to track and share comments. You can also make use of the Checklist field to add and track any subordinate tasks.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 11 of 23  Continual Updates to Salesforce details: Task cards are continually updated with current Salesforce.com details approximately every 4-6 hours. When updated Salesforce.com information is posted to a Task card, you will see a update notation in the Task Description as shown below with yellow highlights. Figure 7 – Saleforce.com Details are continually updated on Task Cards.  In addition, Tasks that have been recently updated will have a blue outline so you can tell at a glance that something has changed since your last visit.  Key Take Away: Marking a Task Completed on the Pipeline Board is the trigger to move that opportunity to the Active Board.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 12 of 23  Figure 8 – A blue boarder around a card is a visual indicator when a Task Card is updated with a new comment or new Salesforce.com details.  Using Labels Planner Labels can be used to help manage and filter task cards. To make the most effective use of Labels, the Board Owners may set conventions for using Labels that the Board Members should follow. Check with your Board Owner before changing the Labels on your Pursuit Launch board. Below is an example of how one Industry Segment is using Labels aligned to their Pods to more effectively manage their Pipeline Board.   Figure 9 – Establish a Labeling Convention to more effectively manage your Board.  Using Filters Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 13 of 23 If a standard Label convention is applied by the Board Owner, the Filter feature can be used to quickly focus on labeled opportunities. For example, you could view opportunities tagged with the Telecom Pod label).  The Filter feature can also be used to quickly find a particular SFDC ID on a task card or a particular client name. The free text filter searches all terms in the Task Title. You can also filter by team members assigned to the Task. Figure 10 – Use free text, Labels, or Assigned Filters to focus on your team’s Tasks.     Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 14 of 23 3.0 Active Board Overview While the Pipeline Boards are principally structured around Deal Category, the Active Task Boards are structured and focused on progressing opportunities through APF. New Tasks start in the Backlog Bucket and can be progressed through different APF Activities as the opportunity matures. This board helps Pod teams see all the inflight opportunities they are actively supporting at a glance and know where each opportunity sits in the APF lifecycle. Since APF is an iterative model, it is possible and expected that an opportunity might go to Deal Shaping, move back to On Hold or Role Based, and even back to Deal Shaping again before progressing to the next Activity. It is also likely that a single Sprint will include Task cards from multiple Activities.  Figure 11 – NCE Netherlands Active Board provides at a glance view of each opportunity’s progress through the APF lifecycle. Just like the Pipeline Board, Labels and Comments are encouraged to increase visibility and transparency into the current status of each opportunity. Many teams are integrating the Pursuit Launch boards into their pre-existing cadence of planning and status review meetings, even making updates in real time with the simple drag and drop functionality.  3.1 Key Active Board Features & Functions  Backlog Bucket – Reactive and Proactive Tasks The Backlog Bucket is where new items added to the Active Board start their journey through the APF lifecycle. Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 15 of 23 While many opportunities will come to the Active Board’s Backlog bucket via proactive engagement from the Pipeline Board, there will still be cases where “Reactive” support is required. The reality is that deals change priority, and that clients largely control the timing and progress of sales opportunities. An opportunity that has been stagnant on your Pipeline Board for many months can suddenly become red hot due to changes on the client side, and bid teams need a way to “raise their hand” and “jump to the top of the queue”. In addition, sometimes it may be necessary to actively support opportunities that do not meet the default criteria for inclusion on your Pipeline Board. For example, a small consulting opportunity or account led growth opportunity may become strategic as a precursor to a larger strategic growth play. The Front Door continues to be a primary channel for bid and account teams to request reactive support. The Front Door Pursuit Launch (formerly Global Deal Intake) request form is used by bid teams to request immediate support. Front Door requests route directly to Backlog bucket on the Active Board As shown below, Front Door requests have “REACTIVE” in the Task title after the Opportunity ID so they are easy to identify in the Backlog bucket. In addition, these requests have the Front Door intake form questions and the Salesforce.com details embedded in the Task Description.  Figure 12 – Reactive Tasks enable pursuit and account teams to “raise their hand” and ask to move to the front of queue when appropriate.  On Hold Bucket As the name implies, the On Hold bucket is a “parking lot” for opportunities that may need additional information or actions taken before they can proceed further through APF. Putting them here gives a visual indicator that some preliminary actions have been taken or requested. With this approach, the  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 16 of 23 focus of the Backlog bucket remains on new items that require initial actions. Role Based Bucket The Role Based bucket is for opportunities requiring individual role support rather than APF support; i.e., just providing a Bid Manager or Offering Solution Architect. When you place a Task in this bucket. a “Role Based” status is automatically logged for reporting purposes. Deal Shaping Bucket Similarly, when an item is placed in Deal Shaping the opportunity status is automatically reported to indicate that this deal is being supported under APF. Dragging a Task from Deal Shaping to Role Based (and vice versa) and leaving it there for more than 4 hours will automatically reset the status for reporting purposes. The status for Role Based and for APF are continually updated every four hours.  Additional APF Lifecycle Buckets To provide increased transparency to Pod members and Leaders, Pod teams should continue to progress opportunity Tasks through the additional APF Activity milestones.  4.0 Pursuit Launch List View The Pursuit Launch List View provides a table-driven view of sales opportunities, as well as enables certain administrative tasks. The List View includes additional Salesforce.com data fields that can be used to gain more insights on an opportunity. Each column in the List View can also be sorted and filtered using key words. You access the List View by clicking the “Pursuit Launch List View Link” that appears on every Task card. This will take you to a view where the opportunity you clicked/selected from is in focus and highlighted in blue as shown below.  Figure 13 – Pursuit Launch List View provides additional Salesforce.com information and enables administrative tasks. Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 17 of 23 As illustrated above, the Pursuit Launch List View has two main sections (that scroll independently). The top section is called the “Canvas” section and allows administrative fields to be updated for the selected, in focus sales opportunity. The Canvas section can also be used to access the Deal on a Page (DOAP) tool. The bottom section is called the “Views” section. The Views section allows users to see additional Salesforce.com information on multiple opportunities in a tabular form. The fields in this section are searchable and sortable and allow users to change the selected, in focus opportunity by entering any Opportunity ID in the search box and hitting “Enter”. There are other tabs in the Pursuit Launch List View that are placeholders for future enhancements or pilots that may be greyed out (depending on your access level). For Pursuit Launch, the main tab you should focus on is the pre-selected APTFPipeline tab in the Canvas section. In addition, in the Views section, the POD Opportunities tab, and the All Opportunities tab are the main focus areas for most users.  Note: Depending on your network connectivity and the current system activities, the List View may take a few seconds to fully load to your PC. If the system fails to load, try entering “CTRL” and “F5” simultaneously to force the system to refresh.  4.1 Key Pursuit Launch List View Features & Functions  Pulling Opportunities from the List View to the Pipeline Board A key function in the Pursuit Launch List View is the ability to search on an Opportunity ID and add it as a Task on your Pipeline Board. As noted in Section 2, all opportunities are not added to the Pipeline Boards by default. For example, opportunities created before January1 2019, are not automatically added to the Pipeline Board. In addition, Pod teams may need to periodically support opportunities with TOV or other criteria that fall outside of the pre-defined scope of their Pipeline Board or restore a Task card that was accidentally deleted from the Pipeline Board.  As shown below, to add an opportunity to your Pipeline Board, in the Pod Opportunities tab, locate the “Opportunity ID” search box, type or copy and paste the ID, and hit “Enter”. This will bring the searched for ID into focus. Important Note: If the Opportunity you need to add to your Board is very old - older than Jan. 1, 2018 - switch to the All Opportunities tab, and search for it there.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 18 of 23 Figure 14 – Search on an Opportunity ID to access administrative functions such as adding a Task card for that ID to your Pipeline Board. For very old opportunities created prior to Jan. 1, 2018, switch to the All Opportunities tab.  Next, in the top Canvas section, click on the Pencil icon (shown above in figure 14), to enter edit mode. In the Kanban column, click the drop-down arrow and select “Yes” (see figure 15 below). Finally, click on the green checkmark to save your selection. This will create a Task card for that opportunity ID on your Pipeline Board in the “On Hold” bucket. This action typically takes about one minute to complete.  Figure 15 – Select Kanban “Yes” and click on the green save checkmark to add a Task Card to your Pipeline Board. Update Administrative Fields Pursuit Launch uses automation to minimize as much as possible the administrative burden on Pod teams. For example, active Tasks that originate from the Front Door automatically have their “Engagement Type” set to Reactive, and active Tasks that originate from the Pipeline Boards are automatically set to “Proactive”. As noted in section 3, moving an active Task to the Role Based or Deal Shaping buckets sets the Support Type to “Role Based” or “APTF” respectively.  However, there may be situations where the automated information needs to be updated or over- ridden. For example, a Task originating from the Front Door may actually be Proactive, or a task from the Pipeline Board may be more appropriately categorized as Reactive. In addition, the reality is that opportunities are iterative and not static. A deal originally conceived as needing our support, may instead be supported though NSSR, by account resources, or Integrated Practice SMEs. To ensure accurate metrics, before Completing Tasks on the Active Board, it is important for Pod teams to assess if the automated tagging reflects reality and make any necessary updates to the status fields. Changing Pod Assignments Based on predefined business rules, most Tasks should have a Pod Assignment automatically identified when the Task card is created. In select cases, the Pod Assignment cannot be identified and populated on the card. For example, some regions have “floating” or “strategic” pods where there are not predefined business rules. Key Take Away: To add older opportunities created before January 1, 2018, to your Pipeline Board, search for the opportunity in Pursuit Launch List View “All Opportunities” tab, and select “Yes” in the Kanban drop-down box. This will create a new Task Card for that Opportunity in the On Hold bucket of your Pipeline Board. This process can also be used to create a new Task card for an opportunity that was accidentally deleted.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 19 of 23 In addition, regional teams may choose to override the predefined Pod assignments in order to balance workload and capacity. The predefined Pod Assignments can be updated and overridden in the List View as illustrated below.  To change the assigned Pod for an opportunity: • Click on the Pursuit Launch List View link on the Task card. • In the top Canvas section, click the Pencil icon to enter edit mode, and use the Pod Names drop- down menu to select a different Pod. • Then click the green save checkmark.  Figure 16 – Use the Pursuit Launch list view to change preset Pod Assignments.  Rerouting to Other Boards (in Region) Similarly, there may be instances where it is necessary to route an opportunity Task Card to a different board within a region in order to balance workload and capacity.  In addition, several regions have Small Deals/Velocity Center teams set up with their own Planner Boards, and they may need to route an opportunity between the Industry/Territory Boards to the Small Deals/Velocity Center Boards based on changes in opportunity contract value or team capacity.  As shown below, re-routing to another board is very similar to changing a Pod assignment. However, when re-routing to a different board, you must first select the receiving region board from the board drop-down menu. Be sure to select the overall region board as illustrated below; e.g., UKIIMEA Region.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 20 of 23  Figure 17 – To re-route a Task to another board in your region, select the opportunity, and enter Edit mode (using the pencil icon), and select your region board in the board name drop-down menu; e.g., UKIIMEA Region. Once the region board is selected, the screen will refresh. When it finishes loading, click the Pencil icon to enter Edit mode. The Pod name drop down selection will now include all Pods in the selected region. Select the targeted Pod you want to receive the request, and then click the green save checkmark to activate the re-route. Figure 18 – To complete the re-route, select the receiving Pod name in the now expanded drop-down list. When complete, the original task will automatically be marked completed on the sending board, and a new Task for that opportunity will be created on the receiving board. Note: You can only Reroute to other boards in your region.  Pod Opportunity Update Tracker and Activation Stats The top Canvas section in Digital Services has recently been updated with a “Pod Opportunity Update Tracker” section. This provides a chronological log of all actions that been taken in the system for the in focus Opportunity. This enables board owners, the Tools & Process Help Desk, and Pursuit Launch teams to quickly check the internal status of any opportunity and aids in rapid troubleshooting and resolution on any service issues.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 21 of 23  Figure 19 – The Canvas section now provides a log of recent actions processed by the system for the in focus opportunity for fast trouble shooting and resolution of any service issues. In addition, this section has been enhanced with analytics showing a running tally of how many opportunities, have been added to the Active Board per day.  Figure 20 – Canvas section now includes analytics showing opportunities per day added to the Active Board.   5.0 MS Planner Standard Features The following sections offer help in using standard MS Planner features. For basic information on using MS Planner, see the external Microsoft Planner Help Center.  Reminder: Pursuit Launch Planner Board Tasks are not like other Planner Boards you may be using. All Tasks in Pursuit Launch are created using automation. • Do not create tasks manually in the Pursuit Launch Boards. • Do not delete Buckets or make structural changes in the Planner Boards without checking with the Pursuit Launch team and your Board Owner. • Do not create new Labels without checking with your Board Owner. 5.1 Adding Members and Owners  Each board has an Owner. Board Owners are empowered to grant access to Pod team members as appropriate. They can also designate additional Owners for redundancy and coverage during absence.  To add new Members, or to designate additional Owners, in the top-level menu of the Board, click the three dots next to “Schedule” and then select “Members”.

Pursuit Launch uses Microsoft (MS) Planner Boards enriched with continuously updated data from DXC’s Salestorce.com and Enterprise Data Lake to enable Pod teams to quickly assess and prioritize the key opportunities in their industry or territory segments. Pursuit Launch has three main components. The first component is a “Pipeline Board” that includes all Sales Stages 1-5 Open opportunities grouped into “buckets” based on Deal Category. All Pipeline Boards have Category A, B, C and On Hold buckets by default. Some regions have additional buckets based on their business needs, such as such as Category D or Small Deals.  Figure 1 – Sample Pipeline Planner Board (UKIIMEA Insurance segment) that visualizes Category A, B and Category C pipeline opportunities.  The second Pursuit Launch component is an “Active Board” of inflight opportunities that the industry/territory Pod teams are actively working through APF or are providing significant “Role Based’ support.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 5 of 23      Figure 2 – Sample Active Planner Board (Americas Technology, Media, and Telecommunications segment) that visualizes opportunities actively being supported through APF.  Finally, there is a Pursuit Launch List View that provides additional SalesForce.com details on all opportunities and enables certain administrative tasks.  Figure 3 – Sample Pursuit Launch List View which provides additional data on each opportunity, including filtering and search capabilities, and supports key administrative tasks.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 6 of 23 Note that while Pursuit Launch leverages the same MS Planner Boards used by many DXC teams, there are some key differences to the standard MS functionality. Tasks in the Pursuit Launch Planner Boards are driven by automation; therefore, typical manual changes used for other boards cannot be used. • Do not manually create new Tasks in these boards. • Do not manually edit the name of a Task or the Task Description. It is also important that you do not delete any buckets from the boards because several of the predefined buckets are necessary to support automation, and additional automation functionality may be deployed in the future. Check with your Region Pursuit Launch Board Owner and the Pursuit Launch team before making any structural changes to the boards.  See the following sections for additional details on the Pipeline Boards, Active Boards, and Pursuit Launch List View.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 7 of 23 2.0 Pipeline Board Overview  The Pipeline Board includes Task cards for each open sales opportunity in Sales Stages 1-5. The Pipeline Boards are structured by Deal Category buckets with opportunities automatically populated into buckets for Deal Category A-C (some regions have additional category buckets based on business need). The sorting of opportunities into buckets is based on a combination of the Opportunity TOV in US$, and the Deal Category code in Salesforce.com (SFDC). The Deal Category code takes precedence. For example, an opportunity with a Deal Category Code of “B” that is below $20M US$ will be included in the Category B bucket). To appear in the board, opportunities must be in Sales Stage 1-5, have at least one offering selected in Salesforce.com, and have appropriate Industry/Territory and Sub-Region 3 identifiers in Salesforce. In addition, note that opportunities that were created in Salesforce prior to Jan. 1, 2019, are not automatically posted to the Pipeline Board. Older opportunities can be pulled into the Pipeline Board by selecting them in the Pursuit Launch List View as detailed in Section 3 of this document.  Figure 4 – Sample Pipeline Board for NCE Switzerland territory (includes Category D bucket due to small deal focus in this territory).  Important! Sales Opportunities must meet the following criteria to automatically appear on the Pipeline Board: • Sales Stage 1-5 Open (cannot be “Won”, “Lost” or “DXC Not Pursued”) • At least one offering is selected in Salesforce.com • Created in Salesforce.com after Jan. 1, 2019 (older opportunities can be added manually as detailed in Section 3 of this Guide) • The opportunity must be created correctly in Salesforce.com with appropriate Industry/Territory and Sub-Region 3 values  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 8 of 23 2.1 Key Pipeline Board Features & Functions  Opportunity Task Cards Task cards are automatically created for all opportunities in the Pipeline Board. Key Salesforce.com details are prepopulated in the Task Description so that you can quickly assess the scope and maturity of an opportunity. Where appropriate, you are encouraged to reach out proactively to opportunity owners for early engagement and Deal Shaping. As shown below, you may find it beneficial to use the comments field to track these interactions. You can assign multiple people to a task. People who are assigned will get notified of new comments. You may also choose to set a due date if there are agreed timeframes for further actions. When the due date is reached, the date will turn red on the card. The card also contains a direct link to the opportunity in Salesforce.com, and a link to the Pursuit Launch List View (see subsequent sections of this document for details on using List View).  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 9 of 23  Figure 5 – Click on a Task Card to see Salesforce.com details, add comments, or set a due date. As shown above with the yellow highlights, you are encouraged to use the Comments field to track your status, actions and team inputs. Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 10 of 23  KEY FEATURE - Moving Pipeline Tasks to the Active Board When an opportunity has matured to the point that it needs to go through APF, or needs significant Role Based support, it is time to elevate it from the Pipeline Board to the Active Board. This is done by changing a Pipeline Task’s “Progress” setting to “Completed” (illustrated below). This will trigger automated creation of a corresponding Task in the Backlog Bucket of the Active Board. The new task should appear in the Active Board in about one to two minutes. Figure 6 – Marking a Task Completed on the Pipeline Board automatically creates a corresponding task on the Active Board. Take care not to mark Tasks as Completed until you are certain the Pod team intends to support it. On the main Pipeline Planner Board view, Completed Tasks will still be accessible at the bottom of each bucket by expanding the “Show Completed” drop-down arrow (see Figure 4).  Completed Tasks can be deleted when they are no longer useful to you or your team. It is suggested that these tasks remain in the completed section of the board for a few days. This allows someone on your team who is looking for that Task to see that is has been promoted to the Active Board). Avoid accidently deleting Pipeline Tasks that have not been marked Completed. Tasks that are accidently deleted from the board can only be restored to the Pipeline Board by selecting them in the Pursuit Launch List View (as detailed in Section 3 of this document). Conversely, if there are opportunities on your board that you are certain will not be supported in the future, you can choose to delete them from your board. If the situation changes, you can recreate those Tasks using the Pursuit Launch List View. Important! Do not make comments in the Description field as you might do in other Planner Boards. Pursuit Launch makes automated updates to the Salesforce.com details in the Description field, which will overwrite/eliminate your comments.  Instead, use the Comments field to track and share comments. You can also make use of the Checklist field to add and track any subordinate tasks.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 11 of 23  Continual Updates to Salesforce details: Task cards are continually updated with current Salesforce.com details approximately every 4-6 hours. When updated Salesforce.com information is posted to a Task card, you will see a update notation in the Task Description as shown below with yellow highlights. Figure 7 – Saleforce.com Details are continually updated on Task Cards.  In addition, Tasks that have been recently updated will have a blue outline so you can tell at a glance that something has changed since your last visit.  Key Take Away: Marking a Task Completed on the Pipeline Board is the trigger to move that opportunity to the Active Board.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 12 of 23  Figure 8 – A blue boarder around a card is a visual indicator when a Task Card is updated with a new comment or new Salesforce.com details.  Using Labels Planner Labels can be used to help manage and filter task cards. To make the most effective use of Labels, the Board Owners may set conventions for using Labels that the Board Members should follow. Check with your Board Owner before changing the Labels on your Pursuit Launch board. Below is an example of how one Industry Segment is using Labels aligned to their Pods to more effectively manage their Pipeline Board.   Figure 9 – Establish a Labeling Convention to more effectively manage your Board.  Using Filters Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 13 of 23 If a standard Label convention is applied by the Board Owner, the Filter feature can be used to quickly focus on labeled opportunities. For example, you could view opportunities tagged with the Telecom Pod label).  The Filter feature can also be used to quickly find a particular SFDC ID on a task card or a particular client name. The free text filter searches all terms in the Task Title. You can also filter by team members assigned to the Task. Figure 10 – Use free text, Labels, or Assigned Filters to focus on your team’s Tasks.     Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 14 of 23 3.0 Active Board Overview While the Pipeline Boards are principally structured around Deal Category, the Active Task Boards are structured and focused on progressing opportunities through APF. New Tasks start in the Backlog Bucket and can be progressed through different APF Activities as the opportunity matures. This board helps Pod teams see all the inflight opportunities they are actively supporting at a glance and know where each opportunity sits in the APF lifecycle. Since APF is an iterative model, it is possible and expected that an opportunity might go to Deal Shaping, move back to On Hold or Role Based, and even back to Deal Shaping again before progressing to the next Activity. It is also likely that a single Sprint will include Task cards from multiple Activities.  Figure 11 – NCE Netherlands Active Board provides at a glance view of each opportunity’s progress through the APF lifecycle. Just like the Pipeline Board, Labels and Comments are encouraged to increase visibility and transparency into the current status of each opportunity. Many teams are integrating the Pursuit Launch boards into their pre-existing cadence of planning and status review meetings, even making updates in real time with the simple drag and drop functionality.  3.1 Key Active Board Features & Functions  Backlog Bucket – Reactive and Proactive Tasks The Backlog Bucket is where new items added to the Active Board start their journey through the APF lifecycle. Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 15 of 23 While many opportunities will come to the Active Board’s Backlog bucket via proactive engagement from the Pipeline Board, there will still be cases where “Reactive” support is required. The reality is that deals change priority, and that clients largely control the timing and progress of sales opportunities. An opportunity that has been stagnant on your Pipeline Board for many months can suddenly become red hot due to changes on the client side, and bid teams need a way to “raise their hand” and “jump to the top of the queue”. In addition, sometimes it may be necessary to actively support opportunities that do not meet the default criteria for inclusion on your Pipeline Board. For example, a small consulting opportunity or account led growth opportunity may become strategic as a precursor to a larger strategic growth play. The Front Door continues to be a primary channel for bid and account teams to request reactive support. The Front Door Pursuit Launch (formerly Global Deal Intake) request form is used by bid teams to request immediate support. Front Door requests route directly to Backlog bucket on the Active Board As shown below, Front Door requests have “REACTIVE” in the Task title after the Opportunity ID so they are easy to identify in the Backlog bucket. In addition, these requests have the Front Door intake form questions and the Salesforce.com details embedded in the Task Description.  Figure 12 – Reactive Tasks enable pursuit and account teams to “raise their hand” and ask to move to the front of queue when appropriate.  On Hold Bucket As the name implies, the On Hold bucket is a “parking lot” for opportunities that may need additional information or actions taken before they can proceed further through APF. Putting them here gives a visual indicator that some preliminary actions have been taken or requested. With this approach, the  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 16 of 23 focus of the Backlog bucket remains on new items that require initial actions. Role Based Bucket The Role Based bucket is for opportunities requiring individual role support rather than APF support; i.e., just providing a Bid Manager or Offering Solution Architect. When you place a Task in this bucket. a “Role Based” status is automatically logged for reporting purposes. Deal Shaping Bucket Similarly, when an item is placed in Deal Shaping the opportunity status is automatically reported to indicate that this deal is being supported under APF. Dragging a Task from Deal Shaping to Role Based (and vice versa) and leaving it there for more than 4 hours will automatically reset the status for reporting purposes. The status for Role Based and for APF are continually updated every four hours.  Additional APF Lifecycle Buckets To provide increased transparency to Pod members and Leaders, Pod teams should continue to progress opportunity Tasks through the additional APF Activity milestones.  4.0 Pursuit Launch List View The Pursuit Launch List View provides a table-driven view of sales opportunities, as well as enables certain administrative tasks. The List View includes additional Salesforce.com data fields that can be used to gain more insights on an opportunity. Each column in the List View can also be sorted and filtered using key words. You access the List View by clicking the “Pursuit Launch List View Link” that appears on every Task card. This will take you to a view where the opportunity you clicked/selected from is in focus and highlighted in blue as shown below.  Figure 13 – Pursuit Launch List View provides additional Salesforce.com information and enables administrative tasks. Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 17 of 23 As illustrated above, the Pursuit Launch List View has two main sections (that scroll independently). The top section is called the “Canvas” section and allows administrative fields to be updated for the selected, in focus sales opportunity. The Canvas section can also be used to access the Deal on a Page (DOAP) tool. The bottom section is called the “Views” section. The Views section allows users to see additional Salesforce.com information on multiple opportunities in a tabular form. The fields in this section are searchable and sortable and allow users to change the selected, in focus opportunity by entering any Opportunity ID in the search box and hitting “Enter”. There are other tabs in the Pursuit Launch List View that are placeholders for future enhancements or pilots that may be greyed out (depending on your access level). For Pursuit Launch, the main tab you should focus on is the pre-selected APTFPipeline tab in the Canvas section. In addition, in the Views section, the POD Opportunities tab, and the All Opportunities tab are the main focus areas for most users.  Note: Depending on your network connectivity and the current system activities, the List View may take a few seconds to fully load to your PC. If the system fails to load, try entering “CTRL” and “F5” simultaneously to force the system to refresh.  4.1 Key Pursuit Launch List View Features & Functions  Pulling Opportunities from the List View to the Pipeline Board A key function in the Pursuit Launch List View is the ability to search on an Opportunity ID and add it as a Task on your Pipeline Board. As noted in Section 2, all opportunities are not added to the Pipeline Boards by default. For example, opportunities created before January1 2019, are not automatically added to the Pipeline Board. In addition, Pod teams may need to periodically support opportunities with TOV or other criteria that fall outside of the pre-defined scope of their Pipeline Board or restore a Task card that was accidentally deleted from the Pipeline Board.  As shown below, to add an opportunity to your Pipeline Board, in the Pod Opportunities tab, locate the “Opportunity ID” search box, type or copy and paste the ID, and hit “Enter”. This will bring the searched for ID into focus. Important Note: If the Opportunity you need to add to your Board is very old - older than Jan. 1, 2018 - switch to the All Opportunities tab, and search for it there.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 18 of 23 Figure 14 – Search on an Opportunity ID to access administrative functions such as adding a Task card for that ID to your Pipeline Board. For very old opportunities created prior to Jan. 1, 2018, switch to the All Opportunities tab.  Next, in the top Canvas section, click on the Pencil icon (shown above in figure 14), to enter edit mode. In the Kanban column, click the drop-down arrow and select “Yes” (see figure 15 below). Finally, click on the green checkmark to save your selection. This will create a Task card for that opportunity ID on your Pipeline Board in the “On Hold” bucket. This action typically takes about one minute to complete.  Figure 15 – Select Kanban “Yes” and click on the green save checkmark to add a Task Card to your Pipeline Board. Update Administrative Fields Pursuit Launch uses automation to minimize as much as possible the administrative burden on Pod teams. For example, active Tasks that originate from the Front Door automatically have their “Engagement Type” set to Reactive, and active Tasks that originate from the Pipeline Boards are automatically set to “Proactive”. As noted in section 3, moving an active Task to the Role Based or Deal Shaping buckets sets the Support Type to “Role Based” or “APTF” respectively.  However, there may be situations where the automated information needs to be updated or over- ridden. For example, a Task originating from the Front Door may actually be Proactive, or a task from the Pipeline Board may be more appropriately categorized as Reactive. In addition, the reality is that opportunities are iterative and not static. A deal originally conceived as needing our support, may instead be supported though NSSR, by account resources, or Integrated Practice SMEs. To ensure accurate metrics, before Completing Tasks on the Active Board, it is important for Pod teams to assess if the automated tagging reflects reality and make any necessary updates to the status fields. Changing Pod Assignments Based on predefined business rules, most Tasks should have a Pod Assignment automatically identified when the Task card is created. In select cases, the Pod Assignment cannot be identified and populated on the card. For example, some regions have “floating” or “strategic” pods where there are not predefined business rules. Key Take Away: To add older opportunities created before January 1, 2018, to your Pipeline Board, search for the opportunity in Pursuit Launch List View “All Opportunities” tab, and select “Yes” in the Kanban drop-down box. This will create a new Task Card for that Opportunity in the On Hold bucket of your Pipeline Board. This process can also be used to create a new Task card for an opportunity that was accidentally deleted.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 19 of 23 In addition, regional teams may choose to override the predefined Pod assignments in order to balance workload and capacity. The predefined Pod Assignments can be updated and overridden in the List View as illustrated below.  To change the assigned Pod for an opportunity: • Click on the Pursuit Launch List View link on the Task card. • In the top Canvas section, click the Pencil icon to enter edit mode, and use the Pod Names drop- down menu to select a different Pod. • Then click the green save checkmark.  Figure 16 – Use the Pursuit Launch list view to change preset Pod Assignments.  Rerouting to Other Boards (in Region) Similarly, there may be instances where it is necessary to route an opportunity Task Card to a different board within a region in order to balance workload and capacity.  In addition, several regions have Small Deals/Velocity Center teams set up with their own Planner Boards, and they may need to route an opportunity between the Industry/Territory Boards to the Small Deals/Velocity Center Boards based on changes in opportunity contract value or team capacity.  As shown below, re-routing to another board is very similar to changing a Pod assignment. However, when re-routing to a different board, you must first select the receiving region board from the board drop-down menu. Be sure to select the overall region board as illustrated below; e.g., UKIIMEA Region.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 20 of 23  Figure 17 – To re-route a Task to another board in your region, select the opportunity, and enter Edit mode (using the pencil icon), and select your region board in the board name drop-down menu; e.g., UKIIMEA Region. Once the region board is selected, the screen will refresh. When it finishes loading, click the Pencil icon to enter Edit mode. The Pod name drop down selection will now include all Pods in the selected region. Select the targeted Pod you want to receive the request, and then click the green save checkmark to activate the re-route. Figure 18 – To complete the re-route, select the receiving Pod name in the now expanded drop-down list. When complete, the original task will automatically be marked completed on the sending board, and a new Task for that opportunity will be created on the receiving board. Note: You can only Reroute to other boards in your region.  Pod Opportunity Update Tracker and Activation Stats The top Canvas section in Digital Services has recently been updated with a “Pod Opportunity Update Tracker” section. This provides a chronological log of all actions that been taken in the system for the in focus Opportunity. This enables board owners, the Tools & Process Help Desk, and Pursuit Launch teams to quickly check the internal status of any opportunity and aids in rapid troubleshooting and resolution on any service issues.  Agile Pursuit Framework (APF) Pursuit Launch User Guide DXC Pursuit Launch DXC Confidential Page 21 of 23  Figure 19 – The Canvas section now provides a log of recent actions processed by the system for the in focus opportunity for fast trouble shooting and resolution of any service issues. In addition, this section has been enhanced with analytics showing a running tally of how many opportunities, have been added to the Active Board per day.  Figure 20 – Canvas section now includes analytics showing opportunities per day added to the Active Board.   5.0 MS Planner Standard Features The following sections offer help in using standard MS Planner features. For basic information on using MS Planner, see the external Microsoft Planner Help Center.  Reminder: Pursuit Launch Planner Board Tasks are not like other Planner Boards you may be using. All Tasks in Pursuit Launch are created using automation. • Do not create tasks manually in the Pursuit Launch Boards. • Do not delete Buckets or make structural changes in the Planner Boards without checking with the Pursuit Launch team and your Board Owner. • Do not create new Labels without checking with your Board Owner. 5.1 Adding Members and Owners  Each board has an Owner.

The organization was using Salesforce and Microsoft Office 365 to manage these activities, but the platforms did not integrate well together and lacked automation. Consequently, Walmart’s ability to track and respond to public correspondence in a timely manner was being negatively impacted.  Client Business Problem Solved The DXC Eclipse practice will be implementing DXC Contact Center Accelerator, Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Dynamics 365, as well as Azure and Microsoft Flow services, to help Walmart better manage public correspondence and improve customer loyalty. This solution will integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Office 365, which was currently in use. Expected Client Outcome or Metric This solution will allow Walmart to improve tracking and reporting capabilities, shrink response time to customers and improve employee productivity. Intelligent automation, assignments and approvals will speed up internal processes; Walmart will be able to optimally communicate with customers. The team can spend time blogging, writing articles and white papers in order to improve brand image. Securing the Win We beat out Salesforce in this win. Our team demonstrated how DXC Contact Center Accelerator, which is an integrated Microsoft solution, could solve their business problem. Our deep retail expertise sealed the deal. Strategic Importance Walmart is a key win for DXC Eclipse because they are a new, multinational client and well-known brand. This win demonstrates how an integrated Microsoft solution can help our clients succeed in today’s competitive retail market where efficient customer communication is vital. It also opens the door to future engagements with the organization.

DXC developed a phased transformational roadmap that prioritizes technology implementations based on the company's needs.,"  Strategic partnering pays off for Ohio Mutual Staying competitive in a changing environment Client name: Ohio Mutual Insurance Group Location: Bucyrus, Ohio Industry: Insurance Case Study: Ohio Mutual Insurance Group Challenge • Maintain competitiveness in a crowded market • Offer an enhanced digital customer experience • Continue to keep IT spending and infrastructure under control Solution • Developed a phased transformational roadmap that prioritizes technology implementations based on the company’s needs • Upgraded to the latest release of POINT IN, a flexible Java-based policy administration system • Increased functionality and flexibility with DXC’s Enterprise Billing, DXC Insurance RISKMASTER™ and Legal Solutions Suite™ • Added account functionality and flexibility with DXC Enterprise Billing and improved customer experience with Insurance RISKMASTER Results • Able to respond quickly to fast- changing market conditions • Able to avoid high maintenance costs of large legacy systems • Can service the consumer, agent and internal user with one platform Staying competitive and fostering growth are two universal pillars of business strategy, whether a company is a global powerhouse or a regional enterprise. In an environment of accelerating technological change and shifting consumer behavior, they’re equally challenging to sustain. Ohio Mutual Insurance Group, a regional property and casualty organization, operating in seven states, recognized the need to respond to changes in the industry. Like many insurers, it identified the need to modernize its platforms and move to a more digital business model that would allow it to satisfy rapidly changing customer needs and desires. “We are driven by what our customers are saying,” says Brad McCormack, assistant vice president of IT for the company. “If we want to continue to be relevant in the industry, we must respond to their needs and do business in the manner that they want to do business. We believe the digital approach is where everything is headed.” Leveraging technology to support business needs Today’s shift doesn’t surprise Ohio Mutual. In fact, what’s happening in the industry today validates the company’s long-held technology strategy. “We started this journey back in 2003. We made a strict decision to stick to a few fundamental principles on our system deployments,” says McCormack. First, McCormack says, the company decided that business demands would drive technology changes. “We consider the business needs and the business demands, and that drives and focuses us on what technology we need to look at.” Second, the company would strive to maintain simplicity. “We believe in a single integrated, administrative, complete policy-processing platform,” McCormack says. Today, the company processes all of its business on one administration system, including all commercial, personal and farm lines of insurance. The company further decided that because of its size, it would align itself with industry-savvy technology partners. “Our strategy is to align with an innovation leader — someone that can provide guidance, and help ensure that we have current, relevant and contemporary systems that meet business needs and customer demands,” says McCormack. In its role as innovation leader and partner for its client of 15 years, DXC Technology developed a phased transformational roadmap to prioritize Ohio Mutual’s needs and to help speed implementation — creating one platform to support Ohio Mutual’s independent agent distribution channel. DXC is helping the company upgrade to POINT IN, an easy-to-configure, Java-based policy administration software component with the industry’s most comprehensive insurance processing functions for all lines of business. POINT IN supports millions of policies and is continually kept current by DXC. Built with a modern, flexible architecture, POINT IN easily integrates with Ohio Mutual’s existing systems. It also allows the company to add best-in-class components to create the optimal environment for keeping pace with the company’s business today and in the future. Case Study: Ohio Mutual Insurance Group DXC Enterprise Billing added account functionality and flexibility, while migration to DXC Insurance RISKMASTER™ will improve the customer experience and enable Ohio Mutual to move off a client/server-centric technology and embrace the API- driven interface movement. The claims department will soon be able to access the claims system from mobile devices and browsers whenever staff members need to see claims information. By using DXC’s open integration ideology, Ohio Mutual will be able to integrate with numerous claims vendors to make the claims adjudication process easier and quicker for its staff. Ohio Mutual will also be opening the claims process to give greater visibility to its agents, vendors, policyholders and stakeholders. To streamline defense counsel payments, Ohio Mutual selected the DXC Legal Solutions Suite™, which will help the claims team digitize a paper-intensive process. All legal invoices will now come in electronically, allowing for quicker review and payment. DXC is also assisting in the legal bill review process, which takes a burden off the claims staff and allows them to focus on making claims decisions. Reaping the benefits of a “lean IT” strategy Companies that have not adhered to a rigorous IT regimen like Ohio Mutual are now paying the cost. The industry’s struggles with large, complex legacy IT estates, archaic policy administration systems and bloated application portfolios are well-documented. Meanwhile, Ohio Mutual’s “lean IT” strategy is paying major dividends. “We’re excited at Ohio Mutual because we have been diligent. We have stayed the course on our systems strategies,” says McCormack. “That has positioned us to say, ‘When these changes come about, DXC is bringing to bear solutions to meet those demands.’ We’re positioned to immediately take those solutions.” As a small company, Ohio Mutual’s strategy has enabled it to effectively compete with much larger carriers, McCormack says. In particular, the company’s alignment with DXC has helped it remain relevant and able to meet current customer demands. “DXC brings 17,000 insurance professionals to its insurance practice. That’s a few more people and a little more resources than we have,” says McCormack. “Whether it’s claims, billing, policy admin, rating, rules, information ordering or document printing — all of those pieces that take the policy and our operations from end to end — we believe DXC is the only software solution provider that has that suite of products.” Learn more at www.dxc.technology/insurance. www.dxc.technology About DXC Technology DXC Technology (DXC: NYSE) is the world’s leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, serving nearly 6,000 private and public-sector clients from a diverse array of industries across 70 countries.
