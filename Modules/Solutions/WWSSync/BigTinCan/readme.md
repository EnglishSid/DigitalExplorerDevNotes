## What We Sell Data Sync into Digital Explorer

### Aim
1. Provide accurate recommendations to workspace users to DXC offerings (all levels)
2. Provide insights to offering teams on associated market trends
   Allowing teams to :
      1. Improve GTM material
      2. Connect with account teams


### BigTinCan structure

What We Sell on Big Tin Can (*BTT.WWS*) is split into 2 main areas

1. Offering structure, description and contacts 
2. Supporting documentation


The **offering structure, description and contacts** is managed at a minimum level within Big Tin Can; avoiding the need for marketing teams to duplicate content and effort.   The content within the supporting documentation holds the key information to provide the level of recommendations we are seeking to meet the aims.


### Outline of approach

Make a series of calls to the BTT.WWS API to 

1. Populate the basic structure of the offering information
2. Add description, contact and asset meta information *(name, URI, type, last modification date)*
3. Analyse asset files and extract matching trends

Call 3 will only be made if the modification date has been changed 


### Asset types to be analysed

- Sales Guide
- Offering Overview
- Customer Presentation
- Buying Factors
-
