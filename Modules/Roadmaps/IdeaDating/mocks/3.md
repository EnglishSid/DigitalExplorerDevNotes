## Idea Matching

Selecting a matching idea updates the information panel on the right hand side.<br>
If the idea has solutions related to it `(Idea)-[:TRIGGERED]->(Solution)` these are also highlighted within the matching area<br>
The user has the option to create a `new solution model` based on a combination of their idea and the selected idea.
