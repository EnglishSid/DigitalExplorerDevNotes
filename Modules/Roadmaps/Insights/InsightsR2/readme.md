# Roadmap Insights R2

1. Within each roadmap trends are positioned in "time segments" within each "client value chain", we need to understand the pattern of common trends with the roadmaps.

2. Trends are also selected as key drivers within client strategic initiatives, we need to understand the patterns of selected trends within these initiatives.


- Frequency of trends within a single time segment
- Frequency of trends within in a given range across the roadmap
- Frequency of trends within strategic initiatives

We should be able to filter or group based on the following dimensions

- All roadmaps
- Roadmaps for a selected industry
- Roadmaps for a selected region
- Roadmaps for a selected industry and region
- All Strategic initiatives
- Strategic initiatives for a selected industry
- Strategic initiatives for a selected region
- Strategic initiatives for a selected industry and region
