"R&D","382285","Alternative powertrains","Alternative powertrains","UKI CT Team","382286","Zero emissions goods vehicles are still experimental. Operators begin to explore the potential for autonomous vehicles."
"","382287","Autonomous vehicles","A driverless car (sometimes called a self-driving car, an automated car or an autonomous vehicle) is a robotic vehicle that is designed to travel between destinations without a human operator.","UKI CT Team","382288","Advancing technology and adoption of brands such as Tesla are making recognised steps that autonomuus driving and adoption by certain cities is making this technology much more accepted and here and now rather than a futuristic fantasy"
"","382289","Urbanisation and megacities","Rise and impact of urbanisation and megacities","UKI CT Team","382290","The increasing concentration of populations within densely populated areas is inherently efficient for infrastructure, public services and potentially for logistics. However, without measures to manage traffic flows, emissions, etc. we have seen high health risks in these rapidly growing MegaCities "
"Leading Edge","382293","Near-shoring manufacturing","Near-shoring manufacturing","UKI CT Team","382294","The relocation of manufacturing or services previously outsources to low cost countries, to mid-range cost countries in relative proximity to the country of origin (e.g. Poland or Mexico)."
"","382291","Reshoring manufacturing (and assembly)","Reshoring manufacturing (and assembly)","UKI CT Team","382292","The return of manufacturing or services previously outsourced to low cost countries (e.g. China), to the country of origin"
"Early Adopters","382297","Last Mile Consolidation","Last Mile Consolidation","UKI CT Team","382298","In some markets (Austria, Germany Switzerland) the delivery of good from the local distribution centre to the final destination in urban areas now directs flows to consolidation centres run by a consortium of local operators to aggregate flows ? often delivering outside peak traffic hours."
"","382295","Shift to scale / in all modes","Shift to scale / in all modes","UKI CT Team","382296","In all modes, scale is a crucial cost- and efficiency driver in volume shipments. Coupled with political pressure to reduce CO2 emissions ? crucially measured grams of CO2 per tonne kilometer, large operators are investing in very large assets (e.g. block trains, high-cube trucks, and ?super-Post Panamax (19,000 container) ships. Similarly, more efficient, cleaner engines accelerate the path to compliance. [Clearly a direct link to ?sustainability?]."

"","382303","Managed traffic flow","Managed traffic flow","UKI CT Team","382304","Typically imposed at central or local government level, adopting improved operating patterns to minimise congestion (e.g. night delivery)"
"Late Adopters","382305","Re-directing assets  to permitted areas of use","Re-directing assets  to permitted areas of use","UKI CT Team","382306","Operators unable or unwilling to buy lower emission assets or adapt existing ones divert these to ?permitted? areas of use - for example ship operators avoid the North American ?EPA? emissions control zone; truck operators assign vehicles to captive location work such as yard work, mining and construction sites."
