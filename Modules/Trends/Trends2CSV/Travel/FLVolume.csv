Government mandates are driving zero emission targets"
"","387921","Augmented Reality","Augmented Reality (AR), sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, Mixed Reality (MR) or blended reality is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.

"","382287","Autonomous vehicles","A driverless car (sometimes called a self-driving car, an automated car or an autonomous vehicle) is a robotic vehicle that is designed to travel between destinations without a human operator.","","UKI CT Team","382307","In many geographies lack of younger labour availability (at wages the sector can afford) push operators to explore the potential for autonomous vehicles"

"","2983","Predictive Maintenance","Predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted.","","","384586","Predictive Maintenance or Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)"
"Early Adopters","382229","Shift to scale; in all modes, driving larger carrying capacity and lower carbon emissions","Shift to scale; in all modes, driving larger carrying capacity and lower carbon emissions","","UKI CT Team","382230","In all modes, scale is a crucial cost- and efficiency driver in volume shipments. Coupled with political pressure to reduce CO2 emissions ? crucially measured grams of CO2 per tonne kilometer, large operators are investing in very large assets (e.g. block trains, high-cube trucks, and ?super-Post Panamax (19,000 container) ships. Similarly, more efficient, cleaner engines accelerate the path to compliance. [Clearly a direct link to ?sustainability?]."

Common models shipped from factory into market for market-specific adaption (e.g. cables/ plus, local language documents)."
"Late Adopters","382279","Reluctance to innovate","Reluctance to Innovate","","UKI CT Team","385266","Historically poor return on assets maintains low margins in the sector, limiting innovation funding. The sector is also extremely conservative; late adopters accept the adverse impact on margin and work harder to sweat their assets."
"","382235","Sweating the assets","Sweating the assets","","UKI CT Team","382236","The physical nature of the industry demands fleets of assets: ships, trucks, warehouses, vans. Demand is cyclical and the services prone to commoditization. Major shifts in demand ? for example to online retailers ? re-balance the power in the sector. Late adopters accept the adverse impact on margin and work harder to sweat their assets."
